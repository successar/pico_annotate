<SOS> A double-blind , randomized , controlled , multicenter safety and immunogenicity study of a refrigerator-stable formulation of Zostavax . The vaccine Zostavax has been shown to prevent herpes zoster ( HZ ) and postherpetic neuralgia and is recommended for individuals > or =60 years of age . This study compared the safety and the immunogenicity of a refrigerator-stable formulation ( Zostavax refrigerated ) with those of the current formulation ( Zostavax frozen ) in subjects > or =50 years of age . Subjects with a negative history for HZ were randomized 1:1 to receive one dose of either formulation . Enrollment was stratified 1:2 by age ( 50 to 59 years and > or =60 years ) . Safety was evaluated for 28 days postvaccination . Varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) antibody responses were measured by a glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( gpELISA ) . The primary endpoints were the VZV antibody geometric mean titer ( GMT ; day 28 ) , the VZV antibody geometric mean rise ( GMR ; days 1 to 28 ) , and the incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse experiences ( AEs ) over 28 days . The refrigerated ( n = 182 ) and frozen ( n = 185 ) formulations induced similar GMTs ( 727.4 and 834.4 gpELISA units/ml , respectively ) ; the estimated GMT ratio ( refrigerated formulation/frozen formulation ) was 0.87 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.71 to 1.07 ) . The GMRs were 2.6- and 2.9-fold , respectively . No vaccine-related serious AEs were reported in either group , and the safety profiles of the formulations were generally similar . The frequencies of injection-site AEs during follow-up were 35.6 % and 46.4 % in the refrigerated and the frozen formulation groups , respectively , and were generally mild . The frequencies of systemic AEs were similar in the two groups , and those of vaccine-related AEs were approximately 6 % in both groups . The refrigerator-stable formulation of Zostavax has an acceptable safety profile and is as immunogenic as the frozen formulation ; thus , the vaccine may be used in clinical settings where freezer availability is limited . <EOS>
