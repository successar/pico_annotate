<SOS> [ The effect of ionic and nonionic x-ray contrast media on myocardial perfusion and myocardial function ] . The influence of injections of Amidotrizoate and Iopromide into the left coronary artery on global myocardial perfusion and function ( pressures in the left ventricle , heart rate ) as well as excitation formation and transmission was studied in 16 patients with ischaemic heart disease . No statistically significant differences in myocardial perfusion measured were found with xenon-133 in this small group between rest and dipyridamole load for ionic and non-ionic contrast media . <EOS>
