<SOS> Influence of lime juice on the severity of sickle cell anemia . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES The pain in sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) is often triggered by dehydration , acidosis , and fever that are usually due to malaria . Intake of lime juice was recently demonstrated to facilitate clearance of the malaria parasite . It was therefore sought to determine whether regular intake of lime juice will ameliorate crisis , especially recurrent bone pain . DESIGN In this preliminary , open-labeled , randomized study , the effects of lime juice on the clinical and some laboratory characteristics of children with SCA were tested . RESULTS Among the 113 children with SCA studied in two hospitals , the 58 receiving lime treatment had lower rates of significant painful episodes than the 55 without lime ( 37 versus 83 crises in 6 months , and 0.64?0.11 versus 1.51?0.34 average rates per child , p < 0.001 ) . Also , fewer subjects than the controls had significant painful episodes ( 50.0 % versus 92.7 % ) ; febrile illness ( 46.6 % versus 87.3 % ) and admission rate ( 3.4 % versus 34.5 % ) ( p < 0.001 ) . The mean hematocrit of the subjects ( 26.23?2.03 % ) at the end of the study was also higher , p < 0.001 . However , transfusion rate , presence of hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , and jaundice was similar . Treatment with lime did not cause any significant side-effect . CONCLUSIONS Regular intake of lime juice may be of great therapeutic and nutritional relevance in children with SCA . <EOS>
