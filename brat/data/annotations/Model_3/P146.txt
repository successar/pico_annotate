<SOS> The effects of preoperative oral pregabalin and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion on postoperative morphine requirement in patients undergoing laparatomy . OBJECTIVES To evaluate and compare the effects of preoperative oral pregabalin and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion on postoperative morphine requirement , adverse effects , patients ' satisfaction , mobilization , time to first defecation and time to discharge in patients undergoing laparotomy . METHODS Eighty patients ( 18 to 65 years of age ) undergoing elective laparotomy were randomly divided into four groups ( n=20 in each group ) : group C , placebo capsules and normal saline infusion perioperatively ( control ) ; group L , placebo capsules and lidocaine 1 mg?kg intravenous bolus dose followed by 2 mg?kg?h infusion until skin closure ; group P , 150 mg oral pregabalin and normal saline infusion perioperatively ; and group PL , 150 & nbsp ; mg oral pregabalin and lidocaine 2 mg?kg?h infusion until skin closure . Hemodynamic parameters , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) scores , analgesic consumption , side effects , time to mobilization , time to first defecation , time to discharge and patients ' satisfaction were recorded . RESULTS VAS scores of group L , group P and group PL were lower than group C ( P < 0.05 ) . Morphine consumption of group P and group PL was lower than group C ( P < 0.05 ) . Incidence of nausea in group C was higher than group L and group PL . Time to first defecation and mobilization were shorter in group L and group PL compared with group C ( P < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSION Preoperative oral pregabalin and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion decreased postoperative VAS scores . Preoperative oral pregabalin decreased morphine requirement and perioperative intravenous lidocaine infusion hastened gastrointestinal motility and mobilization , and decreased the incidence of nausea in patients undergoing laparotomy . Therefore , preoperative pregabalin with or without lidocaine provides superior pain relief in patients undergoing laparatomy . <EOS>
