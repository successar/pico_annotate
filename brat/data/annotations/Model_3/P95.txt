<SOS> Chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan in congestive heart failure . This study was conducted to determine the long-term effect of flosequinan , a new orally administered arterial and venous dilator , on the clinical course of patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure . Seventeen patients on chronic digitalis and diuretic therapy were randomized to receive either flosequinan ( n = 9 ) or placebo ( n = 8 ) in a double-blind fashion . Changes in symptomatology , exercise performance , and left ventricular function were assessed serially during the two-month treatment period . During the course of therapy , a modest improvement in the symptom scores and functional classification of the flosequinan-treated patients was observed . Flosequinan evoked a significant increase in maximal exercise capacity . While long-term flosequinan administration also effected a progressive increase in resting heart rate , it did not consistently improve indices of left ventricular systolic function . The addition of chronic vasodilator therapy with flosequinan to standard digitalis-diuretic regimens is capable of inducing clinical improvement in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure . Trials involving larger patient populations will be necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary study and to determine the extent of clinical improvement , subpopulations benefited , role in heart failure therapeutics , and so forth . <EOS>
