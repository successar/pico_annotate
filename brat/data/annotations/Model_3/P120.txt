<SOS> The effect of cognitive-behavioral therapy versus treatment as usual for anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders : a randomized , controlled trial . OBJECTIVE To examine the efficacy of a modular cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) protocol relative to treatment as usual ( TAU ) among children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and clinically significant anxiety . METHOD A total of 45 children ( 7-11 years of age ) with high-functioning ASD and clinically significant anxiety were randomized to receive 16 sessions of weekly CBT or TAU for an equivalent duration . After screening , assessments were conducted at baseline , post-treatment , and 3-month follow-up . Raters were blind to treatment condition . RESULTS Youth receiving CBT showed substantial improvement relative to TAU on primary anxiety outcomes . Of 24 children randomized to the CBT arm , 18 ( 75 % ) were treatment responders , versus only 3 of 21 children ( 14 % ) in the TAU arm . Gains were generally maintained at 3-month follow-up for CBT responders . CONCLUSIONS Relative to usual care , CBT adapted for anxious youth with high-functioning ASD demonstrates large effects in reducing anxiety symptoms . This study contributes to the growing literature supporting adapted CBT approaches for treating anxiety in youth with ASD . <EOS>
