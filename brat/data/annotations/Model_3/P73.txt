<SOS> [ Effects of auditory integrative training on autistic children ] . OBJECTIVE To explore the short-term treatment effect of the auditory integrative training on autistic children and provide them with clinical support for rehabilitative treatment . METHODS A total of 81 cases of autistic children were selected through the standard of DSM-4 and clinical case study was used . They were divided randomly into experimental group and control one , and respectively received auditory integrative training and no training based on the multiple therapies . The patients were investigated using clinical manifestation and Autism Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) and intelligence quotient ( IQ ) before and after six months of treatment . The effect was evaluated through the changes of clinical manifestations and scores of ABC and IQ . The changes of scores of IQ were determined with Gesell and WPPSI or WISC-R . RESULTS Compared with 40 patients of the control group after the six months of the auditory integrative training , 41 of the experimental group had greatly improved in many aspects , such as the disorders of their language , social interactions and typical behavior symptoms while they had not changed in their abnormal behaviors . The scores of IQ or DQ had increased and scores of ABC had dropped . The differences between the two groups were greatly significant in statistics ( P < 0.01 ) . The decreasing level of both ABC scores and the increasing level of the IQ scores were negatively correlated with age , and the decreasing level of ABC scores was in line regression ( positive correlation ) with base IQ . CONCLUSION The treatment of auditory integrative training ( AIT ) could greatly improve on language disorders , the difficulties of social interactions , typical behavior symptoms and developmental levels , therefore it is positive to the autistic children in its short-term treatment effect . <EOS>
