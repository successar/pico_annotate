<SOS> Clinical effects of root instrumentation using conventional steel or non-tooth substance removing plastic curettes during supportive periodontal therapy ( SPT ) . Although root instrumentation has been accepted as the most important cause-related treatment of periodontal diseases , repeated scaling and root planing may over time result in substantive loss of tooth substance and increased sensitivity of the teeth . In an effort to minimize these side effects of therapy , non-root substance removing curettes have been developed . However , the clinical effects of such plastic curettes with regard to the control of the periodontal infection has not yet been established . The aims of this study were , therefore , to compare the effects of root instrumentation using plastic curettes ( Universal Perio Soft Scaler , Hawe-Neos Dental , Bioggio , TI , Switzerland ) versus conventional steel curettes on the periodontal conditions during supportive periodontal therapy . 40 subjects participated in this parallel , randomized , double blind , prospective longitudinal clinical study following active peridontal therapy . 20 subjects served as a control group and were treated with conventional steel curettes during a supportive periodontal care visit ( SPT ) . The other 20 subjects , the experimental group , were treated using plastic curettes during a similar SPT visit . Clinical parameters , such as bleeding on probing ( BOP ) and probing pocket depth ( PPD ) , were assessed at baseline and 3-6 months later at the next regular SPT visit . In addition , the BOP percentage was determined 10 days following baseline . The results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment modalities regarding BOP and PPD at any observation time . Both treatments were effective in reducing the BOP percentage which ranged from 17-42 % at baseline by about 40 % after 10 days ( mean BOP baseline : 26 % , mean BOP after 10 days : 16 % ) . This clinical study suggests that non-root substance removing curettes may be valuable instruments for periodontally treated patients during maintenance care , thus minimizing trauma on the hard structures of the teeth . <EOS>
