<SOS> [ Limbal epithelial autograft transplantation in treatment of pterygium ] . OBJECTIVE To observe the therapeutic effects of limbal epithelial autograft transplantation and pterygium excision in the treatment of pterygium . METHODS A prospective randomized paired-eye trial was studied . There were 208 patients ( 229 eyes ) with initial pterygium , and they were allocated to two groups : excision of pterygium with limbal epithelial autograft transplantation surgery ( A group , 106 cases and 124 eyes ) and simple pterygium excision ( B group , 102 cases and 105 eyes ) . The criteria for recovery were corneal transparency with stable epithelial healing and no abnormal proliferation of pterygium-like tissue . The post-operative follow-up periods ranged from 18 approximately 28 ( 22.4 +/- 4.9 ) months . RESULTS Some of the patients lost follow-up . In the eyes followed up , 5 of 11 2 eyes ( 4.5 % ) in A group and 41 of 96 eyes ( 42.7 % ) in B group were recurred , the difference being very significant ( P < 0.001 ) . CONCLUSION To provide a new stem cell source , limbal epithelial autograft transplantation , for an injured limb us is a reasonable therapeutic method for the treatment of pterygium . <EOS>
