<SOS> Recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma : a randomized phase III study of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin versus topotecan . PURPOSE To compare the efficacy and safety of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) and topotecan in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma that recurred after or did n't respond to first-line , platinum-based chemotherapy . PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with measurable and assessable disease were randomized to receive either PLD 50 mg/m ( 2 ) as a 1-hour infusion every 4 weeks or topotecan 1.5 mg/m ( 2 ) /d for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks . Patients were stratified prospectively for platinum sensitivity and for the presence or absence of bulky disease . RESULTS A total of 474 patients were treated ( 239 PLD and 235 topotecan ) . They comprised the intent-to-treat population . The overall progression-free survival rates were similar between the two arms ( P =.095 ) . The overall response rates for PLD and topotecan were 19.7 % and 17.0 % , respectively ( P =.390 ) . Median overall survival times were 60 weeks for PLD and 56.7 weeks for topotecan . Data analyzed in platinum-sensitive patients demonstrated a statistically significant benefit from PLD for progression-free survival ( P =.037 ) , with medians of 28.9 for PLD versus 23.3 weeks for topotecan . For overall survival , PLD was significantly superior to topotecan ( P =.008 ) , with a median of 108 weeks versus 71.1 weeks . The platinum-refractory subgroup demonstrated a nonstatistically significant survival trend in favor of topotecan ( P =.455 ) . Severe hematologic toxicity was more common with topotecan and was more likely to be associated with dosage modification , or growth factor or blood product utilization . CONCLUSION The comparable efficacy , favorable safety profile , and convenient dosing support the role of PLD as a valuable treatment option in this patient population . <EOS>
