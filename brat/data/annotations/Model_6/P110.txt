<SOS> Effects of guided imagery with relaxation training on anxiety and quality of life among patients with inflammatory bowel disease . BACKGROUND Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) impacts quality of life ( QoL ) . Psychological factors influence the course of the disease and should be targeted for intervention . METHODS Our study was a prospective , randomised control trial . Fifty-six outpatients were randomly chosen and allocated to a treatment group or a waiting-list control group . Treatment group patients attended three relaxation-training sessions and received an audio disc for home practice . Evaluations performed pre and post-treatment : state anxiety was assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , QoL with the IBD Questionnaire . The Visual Analogue Scale assessed pain , depression , stress and mood . Patients completed a symptom monitoring diary . The control group 's symptoms were monitored without study-related treatment . RESULTS Thirty-nine subjects completed the study and were included in the data analysis . Following the relaxation-training intervention , the treatment group 's ( n = 18 ) measured results showed a statistically significant improvement as compared to the control group ( n = 21 ) ( time by treatment interaction ) : anxiety levels decreased ( p < 0.01 ) , QoL and mood improved ( p < 0.05 ) , while levels of pain and stress decreased ( p < 0.01 ) . CONCLUSIONS Findings indicate IBD patients may benefit from relaxation training in their holistic care . New studies as well as further investigation of the subject are warranted . <EOS>
