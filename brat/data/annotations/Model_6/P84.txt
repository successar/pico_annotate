<SOS> The immediate efficacy of adjunctive doxycycline in treatment of localized juvenile periodontitis . A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study on the immediate clinical and microbiological efficacy of doxycycline ( 100 mg for 14 days ) was carried out to determine the benefit of adjunctive medication in 16 patients with localized juvenile periodontitis . Measurements of gingival fluid flow , probing depths , bleeding on probing and suppuration were determined at 2 periodontal sites with and 2 without radiographic attachment loss , at weeks 0 , 1 , 3 and 8 . Subgingival bacterial samples were taken with curettes from the same sites . Spirochaetes were searched for by dark-field microscopy . Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , pigmented and non-pigmented Bacteroides spp. , Capnocytophaga , Fusobacterium and Actinomyces spp . were cultured on various selective and non-selective media . Bacterial species found at least in 50 % of the patients and comprising on average 5 % or more of the cultivable flora were included in the analysis . Neither short-term clinical nor microbiological efficacy beyond that of a course of mechanical debridement alone was found by using systemic medication with doxycycline in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis . <EOS>
