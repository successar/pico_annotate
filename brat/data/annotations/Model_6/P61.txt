<SOS> Psychological mediators of bupropion sustained-release treatment for smoking cessation . AIM The study aimed to test simultaneously our understanding of the effects of bupropion sustained-release ( SR ) treatment on putative mediators and our understanding of determinants of post-quit abstinence , including withdrawal distress , cigarette craving , positive affect and subjective reactions to cigarettes smoked during a lapse . The specificity of bupropion SR effects was also tested in exploratory analyses . DESIGN Data from a randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial of bupropion SR were submitted to mediation analyses . SETTING Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention , Madison , WI , USA . PARTICIPANTS A total of 403 adult , daily smokers without contraindications to bupropion SR use . INTERVENTION Participants were assigned randomly to receive a 9-week course of bupropion SR or placebo pill and to receive eight brief individual counseling sessions or no counseling . MEASUREMENTS Ecological momentary assessment ratings of smoking behavior and putative mediators were collected pre- and post-quit . FINDINGS Results of structural equation and hierarchical linear models did not support the hypothesis that bupropion SR treatment improves short-term abstinence by reducing withdrawal distress or affecting the subjective effects of a lapse cigarette , but provided partial support for mediation by cigarette craving reduction and enhanced positive affect . Bupropion SR effects on point-prevalence abstinence at 1 month post-quit were also mediated partially by enhanced motivation to quit and self-efficacy . CONCLUSIONS Results provided some support for models of bupropion SR treatment and relapse and suggested that motivational processes may partially account for bupropion SR efficacy . <EOS>
