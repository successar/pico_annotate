<SOS> Feasibility of two dose-dense FEC regimens with growth factor support for adjuvant therapy in patients with early breast cancer : results from a randomised study of the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group ( CECOG ) . Addition of epirubicin to adjuvant chemotherapy can provide important benefits for patients with early breast cancer , but the optimal dose remains unclear . Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens , but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) has proved difficult , with FEC ( 60 ) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC ( 100 ) associated with toxicity . We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens . Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC ( 75 ) or FEC ( 90 ) , with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle . Patients also received pegfilgrastim 6 mg as a single subcutaneous injection on day 2 of each cycle . The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects receiving > or =85 % relative dose intensity and was achieved by 96 % and 88 % of patients in the FEC ( 75 ) and FEC ( 90 ) arms , respectively . Of 147 FEC ( 75 ) infusions , 4.1 % were delayed , while 9.8 % of 143 FEC ( 90 ) infusions were delayed . The most common reasons for delay were adverse events and personal/logistical reasons . One dose reduction occurred during the study ( FEC ( 90 ) ) , related to diarrhoea . Grade 3-4 haematological toxicities were reported in two patients in the FEC ( 90 ) arm . There were no incidences of febrile neutropenia during the study . The most common adverse events were increases in liver enzymes and gastrointestinal events ; no event resulted in discontinuation . Only one patient ( FEC ( 90 ) ) experienced serious adverse events ( vomiting and throat oedema ) . In conclusion , dose-dense FEC ( 75 ) and FEC ( 90 ) are feasible with pegfilgrastim support . These regimens are associated with a very low risk of Grade 3-4 toxicity . <EOS>
