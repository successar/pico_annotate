<SOS> [ The sympatho-adrenergic stress reaction in ear surgery using various anesthesia technics ] . The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of various anaesthetic procedures on the endocrine stress responses during ear microsurgical operations . Simple mastoidectomies , radical mastoidectomies and tympano plastics were carried out in 49 patients under the following randomised anaesthetic procedures : Group 1 halothane anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin ( n = 14 ) , Group 2 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular anaesthesia with lidocaine and ornipressin ( n = 10 ) , Group 3 fentanyl anaesthesia and retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with lidocaine and epinephrine ( n = 14 ) , and Group 4 retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia with prilocaine and epinephrine ( n = 14 ) . The plasma levels of epinephrine , norepinephrine , glucose , lactate and free glycerol were measured in addition to mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) and heart rate ( HR ) immediately before anaesthesia , 10 minutes after skin incision , 10 minutes after having started bone drilling , at the end of the operation and 3 hours after operation . All data were subjected to covariance analysis including the age factor . Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia ( Groups 1-3 ) . Plasma catecholamines ( epinephrine and norepinephrine ) increased significantly in Group 4 ( retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia ) . There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR . The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose , lactate and free glycerol . The beneficial effect of general anaesthesia is documented by normal plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine throughout the operation . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) <EOS>
