<SOS> Effect of simvastatin on hemostasis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia . BACKGROUNDS/AIMS Elevated triglyceride levels seem to predispose to the earlier development and accelerated progression of coronary artery disease . In our study , we assessed for the first time whether simvastatin treatment affects coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia . METHODS The study included 39 patients with elevated triglyceride levels and peripheral artery sclerosis , treated for 90 days with either simvastatin ( 40 mg daily ) or placebo . Plasma lipids , glucose homeostasis markers and hemostasic variables were assessed at baseline and after treatment . RESULTS Simvastatin , but not placebo , administered to these patients reduced plasma levels/activity of fibrinogen ( from 3.5 ? 0.4 to 2.8 ? 0.3 g/l , p < 0.01 ) , factor VII ( from 144.2 ? 16.9 to 112.5 ? 14.0 % , p < 0.01 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( from 76.9 ? 13.5 to 50.2 ? 9.2 ng/ml , p < 0.001 ) , without a significant reduction in von Willebrand factor levels , and tended to prolong the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times . CONCLUSION Our results suggest that statin treatment produces a multidirectional effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and that this treatment may bring some benefits to patients with elevated triglyceride levels . <EOS>
