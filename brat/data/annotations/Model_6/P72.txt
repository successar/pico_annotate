<SOS> [ Effect of transcranial electrostimulation on clinical and laboratory characteristics in patients with gastric ulcer ] . The study included 100 patients with gastric ulcer aged from 16 to 60 years . In 58 patients , traditional treatment was supplemented by transcranial electrotherapy using a TRANSAIR-02 apparatus . Laboratory studies included measurements of lactoferrin ( LF ) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , besides standard analyses . Combined treatment ( traditional therapy plus electrostimulation ) resulted in a significant reduction in duration of the main symptoms of the gastric ulcer depending on the severity of ulceration process , patients ' age and sex . Moreover , it facilitated ulcer scarring and had beneficial effect on dynamics of serum LF and TNF-alpha levels . <EOS>
