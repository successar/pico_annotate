<SOS> Sensory Adapted Dental Environments to Enhance Oral Care for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders : A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study . This pilot and feasibility study examined the impact of a sensory adapted dental environment ( SADE ) to reduce distress , sensory discomfort , and perception of pain during oral prophylaxis for children with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Participants were 44 children ages 6-12 ( n = 22 typical , n = 22 ASD ) . In an experimental crossover design , each participant underwent two professional dental cleanings , one in a regular dental environment ( RDE ) and one in a SADE , administered in a randomized and counterbalanced order 3-4 months apart . Outcomes included measures of physiological anxiety , behavioral distress , pain intensity , and sensory discomfort . Both groups exhibited decreased physiological anxiety and reported lower pain and sensory discomfort in the SADE condition compared to RDE , indicating a beneficial effect of the SADE . <EOS>
