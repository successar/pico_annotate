<SOS> A pilot study on the effect of progressive muscle relaxation training of patients after stoma surgery . Eighteen patients who had undergone stoma surgery were assessed with respect to their anxiety level and self-reported quality of life ( QoL ) on three occasions ; namely , immediately after surgery , 5 weeks after surgery , and 10 weeks after surgery . The patients were randomised into a control group ( n = 10 ) and an experimental group ( n = 8 ) . A 20-min set of audiotaped instructions on progressive muscle relaxation training ( PMRT ) was given to the patients in the experimental group for home practice . Assessment instructions included the Chinese State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( C-STAI ) , the Quality of Life Index for Colostomy ( QoL-Colostomy ) and the Hong Kong Chinese version of the World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale ( WHOQoL ) . Results indicated that there was a significant decrease in both the C-STAI score ( F = 4.66 , P < 0.05 ) and the WHOQoL score ( F = 4.74 , P < 0.05 ) in the experimental group . Among the domains of WHOQoL , a significant difference was shown in physical health/independence and general perception of QoL , with the experimental group demonstrating better functioning . For the QoL-Colostomy , however , there was no significant difference between the control and experimental groups . The results suggest that the use of PMRT could enhance quality of life and decrease state anxiety in patients after stoma surgery . <EOS>
