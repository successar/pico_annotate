<SOS> Effects of low-dose aspirin on clinic and ambulatory blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients . Collaborative Group of the Primary Prevention Project ( PPP ) -- Hypertension study . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may affect blood pressure ( BP ) control in hypertensive patients receiving drug treatment , but data on the effects of low-dose aspirin are scanty . This study assessed the effects of chronic treatment with low doses of aspirin ( 100 mg/day ) on clinic and ambulatory systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic ( DBP ) BP in hypertensives on chronic , stable antihypertensive therapy . The study was conducted in the framework of the Primary Prevention Project ( PPP ) , a randomized , controlled factorial trial on the preventive effect of aspirin or vitamin E in people with one or more cardiovascular risk factors . Fifteen Italian hypertension units studied 142 hypertensive patients ( 76 men , 66 women ; mean age 59 +/- 5.9 years ) treated with different antihypertensive drugs : 71 patients were randomized to aspirin and 71 served as controls . All patients underwent a clinic BP evaluation with an automatic sphygmomanometer and a 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring , at baseline and after 3 months of aspirin treatment . At the end of the study the changes in clinic SBP and DBP were not statistically different in treated and untreated subjects . Ambulatory SBP and DBP after 3 months of aspirin treatment were similar to baseline : deltaSBP -0.5 mmHg ( 95 % confidence intervals [ CI ] from -1.9 to +2.9 mm Hg ) and deltaDBP -1.1 mm Hg ( 95 % CI from -2.5 to +0.3 mm Hg ) . The pattern was similar in the control group . No interaction was found between aspirin and the most used antihypertensive drug classes ( angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists ) . Despite the relatively small sample size our results seem to exclude any significant influence of low-dose aspirin on BP control in hypertensives under treatment . <EOS>
