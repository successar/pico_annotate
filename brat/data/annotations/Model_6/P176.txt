<SOS> The effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on recovery from outpatient surgery . This randomized , open-label study compared the investigational inhalational anesthetic sevoflurane with isoflurane in 47 healthy women undergoing elective ambulatory surgery . The women were randomized to receive either sevoflurane or isoflurane in 60 % nitrous oxide-oxygen . Induction with thiopental 3-6 mg/kg was followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg and fentanyl 0-200 micrograms . Duration of anesthesia , time to emergence , orientation , length of stay in the surgical unit , and hospital discharge were recorded . The emergence , length of stay , and discharge times after discontinuation of sevoflurane were 9.7 +/- 0.7 , 120.6 +/- 8.0 , and 244 +/- 15 minutes , respectively , and for isoflurane were 11.9 +/- 1.4 , 106.8 +/- 7.1 , and 282 +/- 24 minutes , respectively ( NS ) . The isoflurane group had a higher frequency of postoperative cough . At the end of surgery , the sevoflurane group received a deeper level of anesthesia ( minimum alveolar concentration 1.5 vs 1.3 ) , however , these patients were oriented earlier ( 13.6 +/- 1.1 min vs 17.0 +/- 1.5 min isoflurane ; p = 0.02 ) after discontinuation of anesthesia , although this difference is of little clinical significance . <EOS>
