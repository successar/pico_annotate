<SOS> Neural basis of self and other representation in autism : an FMRI study of self-face recognition . BACKGROUND Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by decreased interest and engagement in social interactions and by enhanced self-focus . While previous theoretical approaches to understanding autism have emphasized social impairments and altered interpersonal interactions , there is a recent shift towards understanding the nature of the representation of the self in individuals with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) . Still , the neural mechanisms subserving self-representations in ASD are relatively unexplored . METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We used event-related fMRI to investigate brain responsiveness to images of the subjects ' own face and to faces of others . Children with ASD and typically developing ( TD ) children viewed randomly presented digital morphs between their own face and a gender-matched other face , and made self/other judgments . Both groups of children activated a right premotor/prefrontal system when identifying images containing a greater percentage of the self face . However , while TD children showed activation of this system during both self- and other-processing , children with ASD only recruited this system while viewing images containing mostly their own face . CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE This functional dissociation between the representation of self versus others points to a potential neural substrate for the characteristic self-focus and decreased social understanding exhibited by these individuals , and suggests that individuals with ASD lack the shared neural representations for self and others that TD children and adults possess and may use to understand others . <EOS>
