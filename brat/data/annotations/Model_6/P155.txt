<SOS> Review of the Multicenter Trial Committee report : a prospective , randomized study on the prophylaxis of postoperative deep venous thrombosis . The etiology of postoperative deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) is thought to be due to a combination of factors including stasis , a hypercoagulable state and venous endothelial damage . Methods of prophylaxis are directed toward correcting one or more of these pathologic events . Methods counteracting more than one of these factors can be expected to be even more effective . The combination of dihydroergotamine ( DHE ) and heparin was anticipated to minimize stasis and the hypercoagulable state respectively . Based upon current experimental evidence and current theory , an additional benefit might include minimizing venous endothelial injury by controlling venomotor tone . A prospective , randomized , double-blind , multicenter trial was designed and performed in the United States evaluating the prophylactic efficacy of DHE 0.5 mg plus heparin 5000 U , DHE 0.5 mg plus heparin 2500 U , heparin 5000 U , and DHE 0.5 mg versus placebo . General surgical patients including those undergoing noncardiac thoracic and pelvic operations who were identified at moderate to high risk for postop DVT were included . Study medications were injected subcutaneously two hours preoperatively and every 12 hours postoperatively for 5-7 days or until the 125I-fibrinogen-uptake test ( RFUT ) became positive . Eight hundred and eighty eight patients were entered into this trial and 744 ( 85 % ) completed the study . Results showed a statistically significant benefit from DHE/Hep 5000 compared to placebo ( p less than 0.01 ) and compared to other active agents ( p less than 0.05 ) . None of the other active agents showed a statistically significant prophylactic benefit . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS ) <EOS>
