<SOS> Effect of the essential oils of garlic and onion on alimentary hyperlipemia . SUMMARY The effect of garlic and onion on alimentary hyperlipemia , induced by feeding 100 g butter , has been studied in 10 healthy subjects . The freshly extracted juice of 50 g of garlic or onion , as well as an equivalent amount of their ether-extracted essential oils , was administered randomly on four different days during a one-week period . Garlic and onion have a significant protective action against fat-induced increases in serum cholesterol and plasma fibrinogen and decreases in coagulation time and fibrinolytic activity . The essential oil fraction , which contains all the taste and odour , exactly duplicated the beneficial effects of whole garlic and onion . It is , therefore , concluded that the active principle of garlic and onion is the essential oil , which chemically is a combination of sulphur-containing compounds , mainly allyl propyl disulphide and diallyl disulphide . <EOS>
