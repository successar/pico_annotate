<SOS> Custom-fit minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty : effect on blood loss and early clinical outcomes . PURPOSE Recently , new custom-fit pin guides in total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) have been introduced . Use of these guides may reduce operating time . Use of the guides combined with the absence of intramedullary alignment jigs may lead to reduced blood loss and improved early outcomes . Our aim was to evaluate blood loss and early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing minimally invasive TKA using custom-fit magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -based pin guides . METHODS A prospective study in 80 patients was carried out . Patients were divided randomly into 2 equal groups . In one group , intramedullary alignment jigs were used . In the second group , custom-fit MRI-based pin guides were used . All patients received the same cemented posterior-stabilized implant through a mini-midvastus approach . The volume in the drain bottles was recorded after 48 h. Hb loss was estimated by subtracting the postoperative from the preoperative Hb level . Transfusion requirements and surgical time were recorded . Outcome measures were Knee Society Scores ( KSS ) , knee flexion , knee swelling and pain . RESULTS There was lower mean drainage of blood in the custom-fit group ( 391 ml vs. 603 ml ; p < 0.0001 ) . There was no difference in estimated loss of Hb ( 3.6 g/dl vs. 4.1 g/dl ; n.s . ) and in transfusion requirements ( 7.5 % vs. 10 % ; n.s. ) . Surgical time was reduced in the custom-fit group ( 12 min less ; p = 0.001 ) . KSS measured at week 2 , 6 and 12 showed no significant difference between groups . Knee flexion measured on days 7 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 and knee swelling and pain measured on days 1 , 3 , 10 and at week 6 , 12 showed no significant difference between groups . CONCLUSIONS Using custom-fit pin guides reduces blood drainage , but not the estimated Hb loss in minimally invasive TKA and does not affect transfusion rate . Surgical time is reduced . There is no effect on the early clinical outcomes . LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic study , Level I . <EOS>
