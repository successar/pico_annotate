<SOS> Anti-emetic efficacy of prophylactic granisetron compared with perphenazine for the prevention of post-operative vomiting in children . We have compared the efficacy of granisetron with perphenazine in the prevention of vomiting after tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy in children . In a prospective , randomized , double-blind study , 90 paediatric patients , ASA I , aged 4-10 years , received granisetron 40 mg kg-1 or perphenazine 70 mg kg-1 ( n = 45 each ) intravenously immediately after an inhalation induction of anaesthesia . A standard general anaesthetic technique was employed throughout . A complete response , defined as no emesis with no need for another rescue antiemetic , during the first 3 h ( 0-3 h ) after anesthesia was 87 % with granisetron and 78 % with perphenazine ( P = 0.204 ) . The corresponding incidence during the next 21 h ( 3-24 h ) after anaesthesia was 87 % and 62 % ( P = 0.007 ) . No clinically serious adverse events were observed in any of the groups . We conclude that granisetron is a better anti-emetic than perphenazine for the long-term prevention of post-operative vomiting in children undergoing general anaesthesia for tonsillectomy . <EOS>
