<SOS> Therapeutic effects of combined treatment using tetracycline-immobilized collagen film and root planing in periodontal furcation pockets . 46 upper and lower molars with furcation grade II involvement were selected from 16 patients with periodontal disease . The teeth were randomly allocated to the following groups according to treatment ; ( 1 ) 4 consecutive administrations of tetracycline-immobilized cross-linked collagen film ( TC film ) at intervals of 1 week ( TC group ) ; ( 2 ) 1 root planing treatment ( RP group ) ; ( 3 ) combination treatment ( TC + RP group ) ; ( 4 ) no treatment ( control group ) . The therapeutic effects of each treatment were compared both clinically and microbiologically . Records of plaque index , gingival index , bleeding on probing , probing depth , probing attachment level and microscopic counts were obtained at 0 , 4 , 6 and 8 weeks . The results showed marked decreases in probing depth and density of micro-organisms in both the RP and TC + RP groups . In particular , the TC + RP group was characterized by a decreased rate of bleeding on pocket probing and an increased probing attachment gain . The above findings demonstrated that root planning is effective in the treatment of furcation involvement and that the effects are enhanced by the local administration of TC films . <EOS>
