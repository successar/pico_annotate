<SOS> Prospective study of short and ultrashort regimens of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in an in vitro fertilization program . OBJECTIVE To assess the usefulness of the ultrashort regimen of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist ( GnRH-a ) in ovulation induction in an in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) program . DESIGN A prospective randomized trial comparing short and ultrashort regimens of GnRH-a . SETTING Aberdeen Assisted Reproduction Unit . PATIENTS Forty-eight patients having IVF for the first time were randomized between the two protocols . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Response to ovarian stimulation and occurrence of spontaneous luteinizing hormone ( LH ) surges . RESULTS In ovulation induction , fertilization , and pregnancy rates the ultrashort regimen produces results that were no different to the short regimen but it did not always prevent an LH surge . CONCLUSION The ultrashort regimen can be a useful alternative for ovarian stimulation of patients undergoing IVF . <EOS>
