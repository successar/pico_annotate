<SOS> Comparison of weakness progression in inclusion body myositis during treatment with methotrexate or placebo . We investigated whether 5 to 20mg per week oral methotrexate could slow down disease progression in 44 patients with inclusion body myositis in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study over 48 weeks . Mean change of quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores was the primary study outcome measure . Quantitative muscle strength testing sum scores declined in both treatment groups , -0.2 % for methotrexate and -3.4 % for placebo ( 95 % confidence interval = -2.5 % to +9.1 % for difference ) . There were also no differences in manual muscle testing sum scores , activity scale scores and patients ' own assessments after 48 weeks of treatment . Serum creatine kinase activity decreased significantly in the methotrexate group . We conclude that oral methotrexate did not slow down progression of muscle weakness but decreased serum creatine kinase activity . <EOS>
