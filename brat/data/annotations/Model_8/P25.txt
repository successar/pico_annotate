<SOS> Clinical performance of the Reichert AT550 : a new non-contact tonometer . The aim of the present study was to assess the level of accuracy for measurements of intra-ocular pressure ( IOP ) obtained with a new non-contact tonometer ( NCT ) the Reichert AT550 . Measurements were compared against those obtained with the Reichert Xpert Plus , Goldmann applanation tonometer and Perkins tonometer . Thirty-five university students were assessed with the four tonometers in a randomised order , with non-contact tonometry performed first . Each of the four measurement devices had its own trained clinical observer . Plots of differences of IOP as a function of the mean for each pair of instruments were obtained . No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the AT550 NCT with contact applanation tonometry ( AT ) ( p > 0.05 ) , displaying the closest level of agreement ( as represented by the lowest mean difference and the narrowest confidence interval ) with the Goldmann tonometer ( limits of agreement , 0.12+/-2.17 ) . In conclusion , readings of IOP with the AT550 NCT are clinically comparable with those obtained with Goldmann tonometry in a population with IOP within the normal range . <EOS>
