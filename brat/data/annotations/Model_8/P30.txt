<SOS> Reduced platelet thromboxane formation after long-term administration of a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker : a prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled study with nitrendipine in borderline hypertensive patients with IDDM-type diabetes mellitus . Twenty-nine IDDM patients with borderline hypertension were randomly allocated to placebo or nitrendipine treatment . Nitrendipine was given orally at a dosage of 20 mg once daily over 4 weeks . Stimulated platelet thromboxane formation at rest and after standardized , non exhausting exercise was measured by standard methods . In addition , plasma levels of platelet factor 4 and aggregation responses to collagen and ADP were determined . In the treatment group thromboxane formation after stimulation with collagen ( 0.3 and 1.0 micrograms/ml ) and 1 mM arachidonic acid ( AA ) was reduced in the resting state . Exercise induced change of thromboxane synthesis in response to 1.0 micrograms/ml collagen was significantly lower as compared to placebo ( p < 0.05 ) . In parallel , PF4 plasma levels were significantly lowered ( p < 0.05 ) . Whole blood aggregation after collagen stimulation ( 1.0 micrograms/ml ) was reduced after 4 weeks of nitrendipine treatment , but ADP ( 5 microM ) induced aggregation was not . These effects of nitrendipine were not seen in platelet rich plasma . In conclusion long-term nitrendipine treatment may inhibit collagen dependent platelet activation in the blood of diabetic patients with borderline hypertension . <EOS>
