<SOS> Safety and preliminary immunogenicity of Cuban pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in healthy children : a randomized phase I clinical trial . A new heptavalent conjugate vaccine ( PCV7-TT ) is under development in Cuba . PCV7-TT contains 2 ?g of serotypes 1 , 5 , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F and 4 ?g of 6B , each one conjugated to tetanus toxoid ( TT ) . This vaccine was designed with the serotypes that cause most invasive pneumococcal diseases ( IPD ) worldwide . In the present study , we investigated the safety and explored the immunogenicity of PCV7-TT during a controlled , randomized and double blind clinical trial phase I in 4-5-year-old children . PCV7-TT was well tolerated and as safe as Synflorix used as control vaccine . Following a single-dose vaccination , all individual serotypes included in PCV7-TT induced statistically significant increase of IgG GMC and OPA GMT . These are the first clinical results of PCV7-TT in children and they pave the way toward next clinical trials in children and infants . This clinical trial was published in the Cuban Public Register of Clinical Trials with code RPCEC00000173 . <EOS>
