<SOS> A double-blind , placebo-controlled study of fluvoxamine in adults with autistic disorder . BACKGROUND Autistic disorder is characterized by a fundamental disturbance in social interaction , impairments in communication , and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests . Abnormalities in the serotonin neurotransmitter system have been identified in some persons with autism . No consistently effective and safe drugs have been developed for treating the symptoms of autism . METHODS Thirty adults with autistic disorder completed a 12-week double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of the potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine maleate . Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks of treatment . RESULTS Eight ( 53 % ) of 15 patients in the fluvoxamine-treated group were categorized as responders compared with none of 15 in the placebo group ( P = .001 ) . Fluvoxamine was superior to placebo in reducing repetitive thoughts and behavior ( P < .001 ) , maladaptive behavior ( P < .001 ) , and aggression ( P < .03 ) , and in improving some aspects of social relatedness ( P < .04 ) , especially language usage ( P < .008 ) . Treatment response was not correlated with age level of autistic behavior , or full-scale IQ . Other than mild sedation and nausea in a few patients , fluvoxamine was well tolerated . No dyskinesias , adverse cardiovascular events , or seizures occurred . CONCLUSIONS Fluvoxamine is more effective than placebo in the short-term treatment of the symptoms of autistic disorder in adults . Controlled studies of fluvoxamine and other potent and selective serotonin uptake inhibitors seem warranted in children and adolescents with autism . <EOS>
