<SOS> Epidemiology of stroke . Importance of preventive pharmacological strategies in elderly patients and associated costs . Stroke is a major cause of death and disability in developed countries . The incidence of stroke increases exponentially with age , yet , traditionally , many medical practitioners have been reluctant to treat hypertension in older patients . Since 1991 , the results of 3 major trials -- the British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) trial of treatment in older adults , the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension ( STOP-Hypertension ) and the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program ( SHEP ) -- have conclusively established the benefits of treating older patients ( > 60 years ) with both diastolic and isolated systolic hypertension . International guidelines for the management of hypertension -- including the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee , the 1993 report of the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension and the second report of the British Hypertension Society Working Party -- have all been modified to reflect the emerging evidence concerning the benefits of treating older patients . Cost-effectiveness data are similarly in accord with giving high priority to the treatment of older individuals with hypertension . <EOS>
