<SOS> Effect of indomethacin phonophoresis on the relief of temporomandibular joint pain . The pain-relieving effect of indomethacin phonophoresis on temporomandibular ( TMJ ) joint pain was evaluated in a double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Twenty subjects , who have TMJ pain , were included for this study and randomly assigned to either the experimental group ( n = 10 ) or the control group ( n = 10 ) . Each treatment consisted of the application of ultrasound massage ( 1.0 MHz , 0.8 to 1.5 W/cm2 continuous output ) for 15 minutes to the painful temporomandibular joint . As a conducting medium , 1 % indomethacin cream was used for the experimental group and placebo cream for the control group respectively . Pre- and post-treatment pain levels and pain sensitivity were assessed with visual analogue scales ( VAS ) and pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) . Mean data indicated that post-treatment VAS was significantly decreased and post-treatment PPT was significantly increased in the experimental group , not in the control group . The results of this study suggest that indomethacin phonophoresis provides significant pain relieving effect over the TMJ pain . <EOS>
