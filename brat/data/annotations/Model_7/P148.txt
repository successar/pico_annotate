<SOS> Inference-Based Approach versus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Poor Insight : A 24-Session Randomized Controlled Trial . OBJECTIVE Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) with poor insight has severe consequences for patients ; nonetheless , no randomized controlled trial has ever been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment specifically for poor-insight OCD . A new psychotherapy for OCD , the inference-based approach ( IBA ) , targets insight in OCD by strengthening normal sensory-driven reality testing . The goal of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of this new treatment to the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) for patients with OCD with poor insight . METHOD A randomized controlled trial was conducted , in which 90 patients with OCD with poor insight received either 24 CBT sessions or 24 IBA sessions . The primary outcome measure was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) . Secondary outcome measures were level of insight , anxiety and depressive symptoms , and quality of life . Mixed-effects models were used to determine the treatment effect . RESULTS In both conditions , a significant OCD symptom reduction was reached , but no condition effects were established . Post hoc , in a small subgroup of patients with the worst insight ( n = 23 ) , it was found that the patients treated with the IBA reached a significantly higher OCD symptom reduction than the patients treated with CBT [ estimated marginal mean = -7.77 , t ( 219.45 ) = -2.4 , p = 0.017 ] . CONCLUSION Patients with OCD with poor insight improve significantly after psychological treatment . The results of this study suggest that both CBT and the IBA are effective treatments for OCD with poor insight . The IBA might be more promising than CBT for patients with more extreme poor insight . <EOS>
