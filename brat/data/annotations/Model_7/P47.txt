<SOS> Phase III study of two different dosing schedules of erythropoietin in anemic patients with cancer . PURPOSE To compare maintenance epoetin alfa administered once every 3 weeks with continued weekly epoetin alfa for patients with cancer-associated anemia . PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients were randomly assigned at enrollment to receive three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U subcutaneously ( SC ) , followed by either standard weekly epoetin alfa ( 40K arm ) or 120,000 U of epoetin alfa ( 120K arm ) SC every 3 weeks for 18 additional weeks . RESULTS Three hundred sixty-five patients were enrolled . One hundred eighty-three patients were assigned to the 40K arm , and 182 were assigned to the 120K arm . There was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring transfusions during the study ( 23 % in 40K arm and 18 % in 120K arm , P = .22 ) or specifically during the maintenance phase ( 13 % in 40K arm v 15 % in 120K arm , P = .58 ) . Patients randomly assigned to the 40K arm were more likely to have a > or = 2 or > or = 3 g/dL hemoglobin ( Hb ) increment , were more likely to have a drug dose held because of high Hb , and had higher mean end-of-study Hb levels . Toxicities , including thromboembolism , and overall survival were similar . Patients in the 40K arm had a higher global quality of life ( QOL ) at baseline for unclear reasons , whereas patients in the 120K arm had a greater global QOL improvement during the study , so end-of-study QOL was equivalent . CONCLUSION After three weekly doses of epoetin alfa 40,000 U , a dose of 120,000 U can be administered safely once every 3 weeks without increasing transfusion needs or sacrificing QOL . The Hb increment is somewhat greater with continued weekly epoetin alfa . Lack of blinding as a result of different treatment schedules may have confounded results . <EOS>
