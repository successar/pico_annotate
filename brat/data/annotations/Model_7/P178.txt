<SOS> The effect of tunnelling on epidural catheter migration . A prospective , randomised study of 82 patients having postoperative epidural analgesia was performed to determine whether the tunnelling of an epidural catheter influences its migration . Tunnelling of the catheter subcutaneously for a distance of 5 cm reduced the incidence of inward migration of 1 cm or more ( p < 0.01 ) compared to a standard method of fixation with a transparent adhesive dressing . This effect was more marked if the epidural catheter was sited in the thoracic rather than the lumbar area . Sixty two percent ( n = 26 ) of tunnelled catheters remained within 0.5 cm of their original position compared to 38 % ( n = 16 ) of non-tunnelled catheters , although this difference was not statistically significant . Outward catheter migration was not reduced by subcutaneous tunnelling . <EOS>
