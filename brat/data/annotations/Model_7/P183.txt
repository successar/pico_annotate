<SOS> Prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in the elderly : comparison between preanesthetic administration of crystalloids , colloids , and no prehydration . The practice of routinely prehydrating patients by infusing a crystalloid or colloid solution ( up to 1.0 L/70 kg ) for prevention of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension has been challenged recently , after several reports of failure to demonstrate its efficacy in young women . We compared the incidence and frequency of hypotension and vasopressor therapy after spinal anesthesia and no prehydration with crystalloid and colloid prehydration in elderly patients . Eighty-five ASA grade I or II patients ( aged 60-89 yr ) for elective total hip replacement were randomized to receive 500 mL crystalloid solution ( Hartmanns , n = 29 ) , 500 mL colloid ( Haemaccel , n = 28 ) , or no prehydration ( n = 28 ) over 10 min prior to spinal anesthesia . Hypotension was defined as a 30 % decrease from baseline systolic blood pressure ( BP ) or systolic < 90 mm Hg , and was treated with ephedrine 3-mg boluses . Although absolute systolic BP readings were significantly higher in the colloid group between 6 and 30 min ( P < 0.05 ) , the incidence of hypotension was not significantly different between the groups . The incidence of ephedrine use , incidence of nausea/vomiting , and median total dose of ephedrine were similar in all groups . We conclude that , in elderly patients undergoing elective procedures , withholding prehydration is not associated with any greater degree of hypotension or need for vasopressor therapy compared with crystalloid or colloid prehydration . <EOS>
