<SOS> Intrathecal morphine suppresses NK cell activity following abdominal surgery . PURPOSE The effects of morphine on natural killer ( NK ) cell activity were investigated in patients who underwent hysterectomy . METHODS Forty patients were divided into four groups of ten . The groups received intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine ( Group IT0.5 ) , intrathecal 0.1 mg morphine ( Group IT0.1 ) or 10 mg morphine i.v . ( Group IV ) . The remaining ten patients served as controls and received inhalation anesthesia alone ( Group C ) . Blood samples were withdrawn before and two hours after surgery and on postoperative days one and two to determine the blood NK cell activity using a chromium release assay with K562 cells as targets , plasma catecholamines and cortisol levels . The postoperative pain score and side effects were studied in the four groups . RESULTS In Group IT0.5 , the NK cell activity was lower on postoperative day 1 ( 23.9 +/- 8.4 % ) than the baseline level ( 45.7 +/- 13 % ) before surgery , and recovered on postoperative day 2 . In Groups IT0.1 , C and IV , the NK cell activities showed no significant changes . In all four groups , neither plasma adrenaline nor noradrenaline concentrations changed . In all four groups , the plasma cortisol levels increased after surgery , on postoperative days 1 and 2 . The pain score was lower two hours after surgery and on postoperative day 1 in Group IT0.5 than in the other groups . CONCLUSION These results suggest that long-lasting analgesic effects of intrathecal 0.5 mg morphine suppress the immune response following abdominal surgery . <EOS>
