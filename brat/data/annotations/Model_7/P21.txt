<SOS> The course of depression in recent onset rheumatoid arthritis : the predictive role of disability , illness perceptions , pain and coping . BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the course of depression for patients with recently diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and to investigate predictors of depression . METHODS Twenty-two patients with a history of recently diagnosed RA of less than 2 years were assessed on a variety of clinical outcome and process measures on six assessment occasions over a 21-month period . These 22 patients constituted the control group of a controlled trial and received standard outpatient clinic treatment during follow-up . RESULTS Patients became significantly more depressed over time . A set of five factors were found to consistently predict depression at the following assessment . These were initial level of depression , disability , pain , beliefs about the consequences of arthritis and coping strategies . CONCLUSIONS The results confirm the importance of psychological factors in early RA and their relative independence from physical findings . This is the first study to document the importance of illness perceptions in recent onset RA . <EOS>
