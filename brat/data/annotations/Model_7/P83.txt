<SOS> Randomized controlled trial of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in autism spectrum disorder . OBJECTIVE We aim to study the efficacy of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture in children with autism spectrum disorder . METHODS A single-blind randomized control trial was conducted in 50 children . These children were randomly assigned to the treatment group with tongue acupuncture ( 40 sessions over 8 weeks ) or the control group ( sham tongue acupuncture to nonacupoints in the tongue ) . RESULTS There was improvement in both the treatment and control groups in all assessed measures but more so in the treatment than in the control group : ( 1 ) eye-hand coordination , performance , and practical reasoning of Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale ; ( 2 ) sensory-motor , social , affectual , language , and total score of Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Scale ; ( 3 ) Comprehension Language age in the Reynell Language Developmental Scale ; and ( 4 ) Total Score and Mental Age in Symbolic Play Test . The only statistically significant improvement in the treatment as compared to the control group was seen in self-care and cognition domains of the Functional Independence Measure for children . CONCLUSIONS We had demonstrated that a short course of acupuncture had efficacy in improving various developmental and behavioral aspects of children with autism . The long-term efficacy in functional gain needs to be further explored . <EOS>
