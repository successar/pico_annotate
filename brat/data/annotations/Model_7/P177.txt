<SOS> Fluoroscopic functional evaluation of bileaflet prostheses : effect of different intraoperative valve orientation . Fluoroscopy is a reliable , easy , and readily available technique to follow-up prosthesis functioning after heart valve surgery . The different orientation given to the prosthesis may represent a limitation of the technique accounting for unsatisfactory results in 10 % to 40 % of the cases . The aim of the study was to evaluate whether and to what extent different intraoperative valve orientation influence feasibility and accuracy of postoperative fluoroscopic evaluation of bileaflet prostheses . We prospectively evaluated 90 patients who had aortic , mitral , and/or tricuspid valve replacement with Sorin Bicarbon or CarboMedics bileaflet prostheses . Fifty percent of the patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive prostheses oriented in a perpendicular or a parallel position with respect to the ventricular septum . Fluoroscopic evaluation was considered appropriate when the prosthesis ' tilting disk projection was obtained . The valve 's hemodynamic performance was investigated through Doppler study . A proper fluoroscopic evaluation was rapidly ( 15 +/- 5 seconds ) achieved in all patients with the former orientation , whereas it was impossible to obtain it in 8 of 20 ( 40 % ) , 19 of 20 ( 95 % ) , and 4 of 5 ( 80 % ) of patients with the latter orientation . In the remaining patients extremely angulated , uneasy projection was often required to get a correct fluoroscopic image . The Doppler study showed a similarly favorable hemodynamic performance regardless of valve orientation . Prosthesis orientation crucially affects the rate of success of the fluoroscopic evaluation . The orientation perpendicular to the ventricular septum greatly facilitates the postoperative feasibility and accuracy of fluoroscopy , and it is not detrimental to the valve 's hemodynamic performance . This valve orientation may provide a better fluoroscopic window whenever a valve dysfunction is suspected . <EOS>
