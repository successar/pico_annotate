<SOS> Influence of diets rich in Maillard reaction products on calcium bioavailability . Assays in male adolescents and in Caco-2 cells . The effects of the high intake of Maillard reaction products ( MRP ) on calcium availability in adolescents and across Caco-2 cell monolayers were examined . In a 2 week randomized two-period crossover trial , 18 male adolescents consumed two diets , named white diet ( WD ) and brown diet ( BD ) , which were poor and rich in MRP , respectively . A 3 day balance was performed at the end of each period , and fasting blood samples were collected . Calcium solubility and absorption across Caco-2 cells were studied after the in vitro digestion of the diets . The in vitro assay showed similar solubility after the in vitro digestion and similar transport across Caco-2 cells . In accordance , calcium bioavailability in adolescents did not vary between the diets ( % WD = 40.4 +/- 5.1 , % BD = 38.2 +/- 3.6 ) . Serum and urine biochemical parameters related to calcium status and bone metabolism remained unaltered . Only deoxypyridinoline values were significantly lower after consumption of the BD ( 13.0 +/- 1.1 compared to 18.3 +/- 2.1 nM/Mm Cr in the WD ) , possibly indicative of less efficient bone turnover during this period . As calcium acquired during adolescence is essential to maximize peak bone mass and to prevent osteoporosis , possible long-term effects of excessive MRP intake during this period warrant attention . <EOS>
