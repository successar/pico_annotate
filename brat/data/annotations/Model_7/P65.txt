<SOS> Trial design challenges when combining medication and parent training in children with pervasive developmental disorders . This paper presents the rationale for a 24-week , randomized trial designed to test whether risperidone plus structured parent training would be superior to risperidone only on measures of noncompliance , irritability and adaptive functioning . In this model , medication reduces tantrums , aggression and self-injury ; parent training promotes improvement in noncompliance and adaptive functioning . Thus , medication and parent training target related , but separate , outcomes . At week 24 , the medication was gradually withdrawn to determine whether subjects in the combined treatment group could be managed on a lower dose or off medication without relapse . Both symptom reduction and functional improvement are important clinical treatment targets . Thus , experimental evidence on the beneficial effects of combining pharmacotherapy and exportable behavioral interventions is needed to guide clinical practice . <EOS>
