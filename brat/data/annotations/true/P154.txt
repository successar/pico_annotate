<SOS> Double-blind comparison of doxepin versus bupropion in outpatients with a major depressive disorder . A double-blind controlled study comparing the effects of bupropion to doxepin in outpatients with primary depression was conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety differences between the two drugs . Following a 7-day placebo washout period , patients could be treated for up to 13 weeks on either treatment . Antidepressant response was assessed by the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Scales , Clinical Global Severity and Improvement Ratings , and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale . Comparable efficacy between the compounds was found across the 13-week study . Doxepin differed from bupropion mainly on the sleep factor of the Hamilton Depression Scale , with doxepin improving sleep to a greater extent than bupropion . Doxepin produced a greater incidence of anticholinergic side effects , including dry mouth , constipation , sleepiness , and tiredness , in comparison to bupropion . Also , increased appetite and weight gain were consistent side effects of doxepin relative to bupropion . <EOS>
