<SOS> Regional ventricular performance and exercise training in children and young adults after repair of tetralogy of Fallot : randomized controlled pilot study . BACKGROUND Public-health guidelines recommend patients with congenital heart disease to exercise . Studies have shown that patients with congenital heart disease can improve physical exercise capacity . The effect of training on regional ventricular performance has hardly been studied . We performed a pilot study to assess whether an exercise training program would result in adverse changes of regional ventricular performance in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot . METHODS AND RESULTS Multicenter prospective randomized controlled pilot study in patients with tetralogy of Fallot aged 10 to 25 years . A 12-week standardized aerobic dynamic exercise training program ( 3 one-hour sessions per week ) was used . Pre- and post-training cardiopulmonary exercise tests , MRI , and echocardiography , including tissue-Doppler imaging , were performed . Patients were randomized to the exercise group ( n=28 ) or control group ( n=20 ) . One patient in the exercise group dropped out . Change in tissue-Doppler imaging parameters was similar in the exercise group and control group ( change in right ventricle free wall peak velocity E ' exercise group , 0.8?2.6 cm/s ; control group , 0.9?4.1 ; peak velocity A ' exercise group , 0.4?2.4 m/s ; control group 4.6?18.1 cm/s ) . CONCLUSIONS This randomized controlled pilot study provides preliminary data suggesting that regional ventricular performance is well maintained during 3-month aerobic dynamic exercise training in children and young adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot . This information might help patients adhere to current public-health guidelines . CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL : http// : www.trialregister.nl . Unique identifier : NTR2731 . <EOS>
