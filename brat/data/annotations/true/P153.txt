<SOS> Role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in early antihypertensive treatment in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus . The effect of captopril monotherapy on blood pressure and metabolism was investigated in a placebo-controlled study in 30 non-insulin dependent ( Type II ) diabetic subjects during a 3-week observation period ( run-in/drug ; placebo/wash-out ) on a metabolic ward . Captopril significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( 154/90 +/- 5/2 vs. 144/86 +/- 4/3 mmHg ) without major side effects . Mean run-in postprandial blood glucose concentrations were also reduced upon ACE-inhibition ( 9 a.m. : 12.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 11.1 +/- 0.4 mmol/l ; 1 p.m. : 11.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/l ; P less than 0.05 ) , while blood kinin concentrations ( 40.0 +/- 2.5 pmol/l ) were approximately doubled ( 108.8 +/- 23.5 pmol/l ; P less than 0.05 ) . Body mass index , fasting plasma insulin , serum electrolyte pattern , uric acid , white blood count , lipid profile as well as hepatic and renal function parameters remained unaltered throughout the observation period . The data are in line with recent experimental studies showing a beneficial metabolic effect of captopril in Type II diabetes . ACE inhibitors might therefore become first-line drugs in early antihypertensive intervention in Type II diabetic patients . <EOS>
