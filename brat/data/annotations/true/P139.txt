<SOS> Atomoxetine in autism spectrum disorder : no effects on social functioning ; some beneficial effects on stereotyped behaviors , inappropriate speech , and fear of change . UNLABELLED Abstract Objective : The objective of this study was to investigate the short-term treatment effects of atomoxetine on autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) symptoms in children and adolescents with both ASD and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . METHODS A total of 97 patients 6-17 years of age , with ASD and ADHD , were treated with 1.2 mg/kg/day of atomoxetine during an 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled period . Here , we investigated effects on two parent-based secondary outcome measures , the Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) and the Children 's Social Behavior Questionnaire ( CSBQ ) . RESULTS After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment , atomoxetine administration was associated with significant treatment effects on the ABC subscales Hyperactivity , Inappropriate Speech , and Stereotypic Behavior , and on the CSBQ subscale Fear for Changes . CONCLUSIONS Our study results indicate no beneficial effects of atomoxetine on social functioning . However , atomoxetine may ameliorate restricted and stereotyped behaviors and communication .
