<SOS> Training referential communicative skills to individuals with autism spectrum disorder : a pilot study . The present study reports the effects of referential communication training in individuals formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Participants were 20 children with ASD ( M age = 14.3 yr. , SD = 4.2 ; 6 girls , 14 boys ) in the role of speakers and 20 control children , who acted as listeners . They were all enrolled in mainstream compulsory education . Inclusion/exclusion criteria were defined according to the clinical diagnosis of ASD , the presence or absence of additional or associated disability , previous training in referential communication , and any drug treatment . Speakers were randomly assigned to one of two groups ( trained vs untrained ) . Linguistic age , cognitive level and autistic symptoms were analyzed , respectively , with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test ( PPVT ) , the Wechsler Intelligence Scale ( WISC-R or WAIS-III ) , and the Autistic Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) . Communicative abilities were analyzed through two indexes related to message complexity and self-regulation . The trained group was trained in referential communication tasks ( task analysis , role taking , and task evaluation ) , while the untrained group took part in a communicative game but without any specific communicative training . The results showed that the complexity of emitted messages had improved statistically significantly in the trained group as an effect of training . Ecological referential communication is shown to be an appropriate paradigm for studying the communicative process and its products and could be used to develop and implement a training program focused on those skills in which individuals with ASD are most deficient . <EOS>
