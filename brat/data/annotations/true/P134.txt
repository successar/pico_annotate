<SOS> Assessment of acute bronchodilator effects from specific airway resistance changes in stable COPD patients . BACKGROUND In COPD patients , reversibility is currently evaluated from the changes of forced expiratory volume at 1s ( ?FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity ( ?FVC ) . By lowering peripheral airway smooth muscle tone , bronchodilators should decrease dynamic hyperinflation , gas trapping , and possibly dyspnea at rest . Hence , we hypothesize that specific airway resistance changes ( ?sRAW ) should better characterize the acute response to bronchodilators . METHODS On two days , 60 COPD patients underwent dyspnea evaluation ( VAS score ) and pulmonary function testing at baseline and one hour after placebo or 300?g indacaterol administration . RESULTS Spirographic and ?sRAW-based criteria identified as responders 24 and 45 patients , respectively . ?sRAW correlated with changes of intrathoracic gas volume ( ?ITGV ) ( r=0.61 ; p < 0.001 ) , residual volume ( ?RV ) ( r=0.60 ; p < 0.001 ) , ?FVC ( r=0.44 ; p=0.001 ) , and ?VAS ( r=0.73 ; p < 0.001 ) , while ?FEV1 correlated only with ?FVC ( r=0.34 ; p=0.008 ) . Significant differences in terms of ?ITGV ( p=0.002 ) , ?RV ( p=0.023 ) , and ?VAS ( p < 0.001 ) occurred only if patients were stratified according to ?sRAW . CONCLUSIONS In assessing the acute functional effect of bronchodilators , ?sRAW-based criterion is preferable to FEV1-FVC-based criteria , being more closely related to bronchodilator-induced improvements of lung mechanics and dyspnea at rest . <EOS>
