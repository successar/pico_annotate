<SOS> Economic evaluation of aquatic exercise for persons with osteoarthritis . OBJECTIVES To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation aquatic exercise classes from the societal perspective . DESIGN Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes . Cost per quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) gained was estimated using trial data . Sample size was based on 80 % power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost/QALY gained would not exceed $ 50,000 . SUBJECTS AND METHODS Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to participate in aquatic classes . The Quality of Well-Being Scale ( QWB ) and Current Health Desirability Rating ( CHDR ) were used for economic evaluation , supplemented by the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) , Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale ( CES-D ) , and Perceived Quality of Life Scale ( PQOL ) collected at baseline and postclass . Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs . Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries/questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs . Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs/QALY ratios established the 95 % CI around the estimates . RESULTS Aquatic exercisers reported equal ( QWB ) or better ( CHDR , HAQ , PQOL ) health-related quality of life compared with controls . Outcomes improved with regular class attendance . Costs/QALY gained discounted at 3 % were $ 205,186 using the QWB and $ 32,643 using the CHRD . CONCLUSION Aquatic exercise exceeded $ 50,000 per QALY gained using the community-weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant-weighted measure . Confidence intervals around these ratios suggested wide variability of cost effectiveness of aquatic exercise . <EOS>
