<SOS> Once-daily amoxicillin versus twice-daily penicillin V in group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis . BACKGROUND Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal ( GABHS ) pharyngitis . OBJECTIVE To test the non-inferiority of once-daily ( QD ) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily ( BID ) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis . METHODS This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand . Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD ( or 750 mg if bodyweight was < or=30 kg ) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID ( or 250 mg if bodyweight was < or=20 kg ) for 10 days . Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence . OUTCOME Eradication of GABHS , determined with follow-up throat cultures on days 3-6 , 12-16 and 26-36 . GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures ( and relapses ) from new acquisitions . Non-inferiority was defined as an upper 95 % confidence limit ( CL ) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of < or=10 % . RESULTS 353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin ( n = 177 ) or penicillin V ( n = 176 ) . The upper 95 % CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9 % at days 3-6 , 6.5 % at days 12-16 and 8.5 % at days 26-36 . Treatment failures ( including relapses ) occurred at each visit in 5.8 % , 12.7 % and 10.7 % of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2 % , 11.9 % and 11.3 % of penicillin V recipients , respectively . No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups . One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin . CONCLUSION In this adequately powered study , once-daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice-daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis . <EOS>
