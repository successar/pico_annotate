<SOS> A double-blind , randomized , controlled , multicenter study to assess the safety and cardiovascular effects of skeletal myoblast implantation by catheter delivery in patients with chronic heart failure after myocardial infarction . BACKGROUND We sought to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of transcatheter intramyocardial administration of myoblasts in patients with heart failure ( HF ) . METHODS MARVEL is a randomized placebo-controlled trial of image-guided , catheter-based intramyocardial injection of placebo or myoblasts ( 400 or 800 million ) in patients with class II to IV HF and ejection fraction < 35 % . Primary end points were frequency of serious adverse events ( safety ) and changes in 6-minute walk test and Minnesota Living With HF score ( efficacy ) . Of 330 patients intended for enrollment , 23 were randomized ( MARVEL-1 ) before stopping the study for financial reasons . RESULTS At 6 months , similar numbers of events occurred in each group : 8 ( placebo ) , 7 ( low dose ) , and 8 ( high dose ) , without deaths . Ventricular tachycardia responsive to amiodarone was more frequent in myoblast-treated patients : 1 ( placebo ) , 3 ( low dose ) , and 4 ( high dose ) . A trend toward improvement in functional capacity was noted in myoblast-treated groups ( ?6-minute walk test of -3.6 vs +95.6 vs +85.5 m [ placebo vs low dose vs high dose ; P = .50 ] ) without significant changes in Minnesota Living With HF scores . CONCLUSIONS In HF patients with chronic postinfarction cardiomyopathy , transcatheter administration of myoblasts in doses of 400 to 800 million cells is feasible and may lead to important clinical benefits . Ventricular tachycardia may be provoked by myoblast injection but appears to be a transient and treatable problem . A large-scale outcome trial of myoblast administration in HF patients with postinfarction cardiomyopathy is feasible and warranted . <EOS>
