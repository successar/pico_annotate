<SOS> Double-blind randomized evaluation of intercostal nerve blocks as an adjuvant to subarachnoid administered morphine for post-thoracotomy analgesia . BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Thoracotomy is associated with pain and compromised pulmonary function . Intercostal nerve blocks ( INB ) and subarachnoid morphine ( SM ) act on different portions of the pain pathway . Each is effective for post-thoracotomy pain relief . The combination of these two modalities in relieving post-thoracotomy pain and improving postoperative pulmonary function has not been investigated . METHODS In a double-blind study , 20 patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy for lung resection were randomized to receive 0.5 mg SM preoperatively and INB with bupivacaine ( INB+ ) prior to wound closure or 0.5 mg SM with INB using saline ( INB- ) . Visual analog scale pain scores at rest , with cough , and with movement of the ipsilateral arm , forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) , and forced vital capacity ( FVC ) were measured at 4 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours after the operation . Opioid use was measured during the initial 24 hours after the operation . RESULTS At 4 hours , the INB+ group demonstrated better FEV1 ( 56.6 % vs. 40.4 % of baseline , P < .05 ) and FVC values ( 54.6 % vs. 39.6 % of baseline , P < .05 ) and less resting and cough pain ( P < .05 ) . However , FEV1 continued to decline in the INB+ group at 24 hours to lower than the INB- group although pain scores were similar beyond 4 hours . Opioid usage during the first 24 hours was similar ( INB- , 16.7 mg vs. INB+ , 13.2 mg , P = .7 ) . CONCLUSIONS Although postoperative INB provided modest improvements in pain and pulmonary function when used as an adjuvant to 0.5 mg SM for post-thoracotomy analgesia , the benefits were transient . The authors do not recommend adding INB for patients undergoing lateral thoracotomy who receive 0.5 mg SM . <EOS>
