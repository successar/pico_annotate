<SOS> Plasma AGE-peptides and C-peptide in early-stage diabetic nephropathy patients on thiamine and pyridoxine therapy . AIM The aim of the study was to evaluate circulatory AGE-peptide levels in diabetic nephropathy and to observe the effects of thiamine ( vitamin B1 ) and pyridoxine ( vitamin B6 ) therapy . METHODS Type 2 diabetic patients ( N.=57 ) were divided into two groups as with nephropathy ( N.=27 ) and without nephropathy ( N.=30 ) . Diabetic nephropathy patients were treated with either B6 ( N.=12 ) ( 250 mg/day ) or B1+B6 ( N.=15 ) ( 250 mg/day , each ) for five months . At the beginning and the end of the experimentation period , glucose , HbA1c , triglyceride , cholesterol , insulin , C-peptide , thiamine pyrophosphate , pyridoxal phosphate and AGE- peptides were measured . RESULTS AGE-peptides were higher in the diabetic group with nephropathy than without nephropathy ( P=0.005 ) . Within five months AGE-peptides increased in the diabetic group without nephropathy ( P=0.042 ) but not in the group with nephropathy treated either with B1+B6 or B6 . In B6 treated group a substantial decrease was observed in HbA1c ( P=0.033 ) . B1+B6 or B6 treatment both caused an increase in C-peptide ( P=0.006 , P=0.004 ) . CONCLUSION Among the parameters measured , plasma AGE-peptides was the only parameter found to be higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with nephropathy than without nephropathy . However , patients with nephropathy treated with B1+B6 or B6 did not display any further increase in AGE-peptides within five months . Both of the treatments caused an increase in C-peptide . <EOS>
