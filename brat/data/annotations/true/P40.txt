<SOS> [ Postural biofeedback and locomotion reeducation in stroke patients ] . AIMS To compare , in post-acute hemiparetic patients , gait improvement after conventional physical therapy alone or with a specialised balance retraining program . PATIENTS Twenty-six patients within 3 months of onset of stroke were randomised to receive physical therapy ( control group ) or therapy and retraining ( experimental group ) , most of the patients in both groups with left hemiplegia . The experimental group was significantly older than the control group . METHOD Thirteen patients received early conventional therapy , and 13 received therapy combined with standing balance training by biofeedback ( BPM Monitor ) . Clinical measures were collected at entry ( J0 ) , once when subjects began to walk ( JM ) and 30 days later ( JM + 30 ) . Gait spatiotemporal parameters were collected by use of the Vicon system at JM and JM + 30 . RESULTS Whatever the method of rehabilitation , the clinical scores improved significantly between J0 and JM + 30 , except for spasticity . The time between stroke and the beginning of walking was not significantly different between both groups . Gait velocity increased significantly between JM and JM + 30 in both groups , with no difference between groups . The walking pattern was improved for both groups , with a significant increase of the duration of the paretic limb single stance . The experimental group significantly improved the duration of the reception double stance on the paretic limb between JM and JM + 30 compared with the control group ( P = 0.03 ) . CONCLUSION Both groups demonstrated improvement in the rehabilitation unit . The benefits of visual biofeedback by forceplate system training suggest particular improvement of anticipation equilibrium with conventional therapy . <EOS>
