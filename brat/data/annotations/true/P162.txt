<SOS> Experimental hyaline membrane disease in the premature monkey : effects of antenatal dexamethasone . A blind , randomized trial of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment was conducted using the premature monkey ( Macaca nemestrina ) model of hyaline membrane disease ( HMD ) . Twelve dams received dexamethasone ( 2 mg/dose ) 72 , 48 , and 24 h before abdominal delivery at 135 +/- 1 days of gestation . Twelve control animals received saline . Infants of dexamethasone-treated dams had significantly lower incidence and severity of HMD than did infants of control animals ( 50 versus 92 % , p less than 0.05 ) . Improvement with treatment was markedly greater for males than for females . Differences in volume-pressure behavior of the excised lungs included greater distensibility in the infants from dexamethasone-treated dams ( 20.6 +/- 7.1 ml/g dry lung versus 14.7 +/- 6.1 , p less than 0.05 ) and enhanced deflation stability with treatment . Accelerated production of surface active material ( SAM ) phospholipids in infants from dexamethasone-treated dams was indicated by increases in total lung phospholipid ( 84.5 +/- 8.1 mg/g dry lung versus 75.1 +/- 9.9 , p less than 0.025 ) , alveolar lavage fluid phospholipid ( 5.65 +/- 3.33 mg/g dry lung versus 3.01 +/- 1.84 , p less than 0.05 ) , and alveolar lavage fluid disaturated phosphatidylcholine ( DPC ) ( 2.47 +/- 1.84 mg/g dry lung versus 1.06 +/- 1.05 , p less than 0.05 ) . Incorporation of 14C-palmitate into lung lipid was not influenced by dexamethasone , but a significantly greater portion of the label appeared in the DPC fraction with treatment . Antenatal dexamethasone treatment was successful in reducing the incidence and severity of experimental HMD in this animal model ; the beneficial effects of treatment were associated with accelerated maturation of fetal pulmonary functions , including , but not limited to , synthetic metabolism of SAM phospholipid . <EOS>
