<SOS> Gastric dysrhythmia in infants with gastrointestinal diseases measured by epigastric impedance . BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in association with myoelectrical dysrhythmia , where different types of gastric electrical activity have been described . These types of gastric myoelectrical activity and dysrhythmia can be measured by electrogastrography using cutaneous electrodes . Epigastric impedance is a non-invasive method used to study gastric emptying time and gastric phasic activity . At present no study of gastric dysrhythmia , measured with epigastric impedance , has been presented , and the purpose of the present study was to investigate gastric rhythms by means of impedance gastrography in control infants , compared to infants with different gastrointestinal diseases , before and after treatment of their disease . METHOD 21 patients ( age 0-2 months ) and 40 healthy infants ( age 0-2 months ) were investigated . The patients suffered from partial or total intestinal obstruction , necrotizing enterocolitis or pyloric stenosis.All infants were fasting and studied during periods of at least one hour . The patients were examined in the acute state and after treatment when possible . RESULTS A pathologic result was found in 90 % of the patients . A persistent phasic activity pattern was found in 19 of the 21 patients , high frequency phasic activity in 11 of the 21 patients . Short-term phasic activity was only found in 13 out of 40 of the normal infants ( 32.5 % ) . CONCLUSION Using epigastric impedance we found that infants with partial or total intestinal obstruction had gastric phasic activity , which was not found in the control infants . The origin of the gastric phasic activity patterns is unknown , but they may be related to electrical control activity . <EOS>
