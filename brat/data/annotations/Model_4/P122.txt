<SOS> Social skills improvement in children with high-functioning autism : a pilot randomized controlled trial . High-functioning autism ( HFA ) is characterized by persistent impairment in social interaction despite the absence of mental retardation . Although an increasing number of group-based programs for the improvement of social skills have been described , randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy . To compare the effect of a Social Skills Training Group-based Program ( SST-GP ) and a Leisure Activities Group-based Program ( LA-GP ) on the perception of facial emotions and quality of life ( QoL ) in young people with HFA . Eligible patients were children and adolescents with HFA . Participants were randomized to the SST or LA group . The primary outcome was defined as an improvement of 2 points in error rates for facial emotion labeling ( DANVA2 ) from baseline . After the 6-month training period , the SST Group made fewer errors in labeling anger on adult faces , whereas error rates in the LA Group remained stable . Progress in the ability to recognize anger in the SST Group was due to better recognition of low intensity stimuli on adult faces . QoL increased in the SST Group in the dimension of school environment , as a marker of the transfer of skills acquired in the treatment setting to their use in the community . The SST-GP had higher efficacy than the LA-GP . Data justify replication using larger samples . <EOS>
