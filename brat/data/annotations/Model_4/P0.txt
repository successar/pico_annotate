<SOS> Comparison of budesonide Turbuhaler with budesonide aqua in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis . Rhinocort Study Group . OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of budesonide Turbuhaler 400 microg/day with budesonide aqua 256 microg/day in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) . Secondarily to ascertain patients ' preferences for the two nasal devices and to assess quality of life . DESIGN Randomized , multicentre , double-blind , double- dummy , parallel groups study . SETTING Private practices and hospital clinics in Ontario , Quebec and Manitoba . POPULATION Two hundred and eighty-four out-patients with SAR , who were symptomatic during the ragweed season , volunteered for enrolment ( 243 randomized ) . RESULTS Mean daily nasal symptom scores were significantly reduced with treatment . There were no statistically significant changes from baseline for eye symptoms . Most patients ( more than 80 % ) achieved substantial control of their symptoms with budesonide . The most common nasal and non-nasal adverse events for both groups were epistaxis and headache . Turbuhaler was easier to use and more convenient to carry , had less of an unpleasant taste , and caused less nasal irritation than the aqua spray . More than twice as many patients preferred Turbuhaler to the aqua spray ( 69 % versus 31 % ) . Improvement in quality of life from baseline to clinic visits was statistically significant in both groups . CONCLUSION Once daily use of 256 mg of budesonide aqua and 400 mg of budesonide Turbuhaler are equally safe and efficacious in the treatment of SAR . Patients preferred the budesonide powder formulation delivered via Turbuhaler two to one over the aqua formulation . <EOS>
