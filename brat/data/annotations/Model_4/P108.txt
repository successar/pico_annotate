<SOS> Group cognitive behavior therapy for children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders and anxiety : a randomized trial . BACKGROUND Children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) are at high risk for developing significant anxiety . Anxiety can adversely impact functioning across school , home and community environments . Cognitive behavioral therapies ( CBT ) are frequently used with success for children with anxiety symptoms . Modified CBT interventions for anxiety in children with ASD have also yielded promising results . METHODS Fifty children with high-functioning ASD and anxiety were randomizedto group CBT or treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) for 12 weeks . Independent clinical evaluators , blind to condition , completed structured interviews ( Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule ? Parent Version ; ADIS-P ) pre- and post-intervention condition . RESULTS Forty-seven children completed either the CBT or TAU condition . Results indicated markedly better outcomes for the CBT group . Significant differences by group were noted in Clinician Severity Ratings , diagnostic status , and clinician ratings of global improvement . In the intent-to-treat sample , 10 of 20 children ( 50 % ) in the CBT group had a clinically meaningful positive treatment response , compared to 2 of 23 children ( 8.7 % ) in the TAU group . CONCLUSIONS Initial results from this randomized , designed treatment study suggest that agroup CBT intervention specifically developed for children with ASD may be effective in decreasing anxiety . Limitations of this study include small sample size , lack of an attention control group , and use of outcome measures normed with typically developing children <EOS>
