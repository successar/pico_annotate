<SOS> Cophenylcaine spray vs. placebo in flexible nasendoscopy : a prospective double-blind randomised controlled trial . Practices vary across the UK on the use of topical preparation prior to flexible fibreoptic nasendoscopy . In this double-blind study , we randomised 98 patients to receive cophenylcaine or placebo nasal spray before flexible nasendoscopy . A visual analogue scale ( 1-100 ) was used to record pain , unpleasantness of taste and overall discomfort experienced . Overall , the procedure was associated with minimal pain and discomfort in both groups . There was no significant difference in pain or overall discomfort experienced between the two groups ; however , the sensation of bad taste was significantly worse in the cophenylcaine group . In linear regression , factors that predicted the overall unpleasantness of the experience were primarily pain experienced and secondarily unpleasantness of taste . We conclude that the routine use of cophenylcaine for nasal preparation is not justified before flexible nasendoscopy . <EOS>
