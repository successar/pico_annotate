<SOS> Adherence to lifestyle recommendations by patients with depression . INTRODUCTION There is an increasing amount of evidence showing that physical activity and sun exposure are effective coadjuvant treatments for patients with mild to moderate depression . However , there is a lack of information regarding patient 's adherence to these recommendations in daily clinical practice . METHODS We conducted a study including 15 depressive patients who had been under antidepressant treatment for at least one month . They wore a wrist-watch-like actimetry sensor to measure physical activity and sun exposure 24 hours a day . After one week of baseline assessment , patients were randomised into one of the two arms of the study . Patients in the experimental group received a brief note in which they were explicitly asked to increase both their physical activity level and time of sun exposure , while control group patients did not receive these explicit recommendations . RESULTS One week after recommendations were delivered , only patients in the experimental group had increased time of sun exposure and physical activity ( 25.8 % and 14.3 % , respectively ) . CONCLUSIONS Depressive patients are able to follow prescribed lifestyle recommendations in the short-term . <EOS>
