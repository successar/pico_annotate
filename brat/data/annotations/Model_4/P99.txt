<SOS> Use of hormonal contraceptives and risk of HIV-1 transmission : a prospective cohort study . BACKGROUND Hormonal contraceptives are used widely but their effects on HIV-1 risk are unclear . We aimed to assess the association between hormonal contraceptive use and risk of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from HIV-1-infected women to their male partners . METHODS In this prospective study , we followed up 3790 heterosexual HIV-1-serodiscordant couples participating in two longitudinal studies of HIV-1 incidence in seven African countries . Among injectable and oral hormonal contraceptive users and non-users , we compared rates of HIV-1 acquisition by women and HIV-1 transmission from women to men . The primary outcome measure was HIV-1 seroconversion . We used Cox proportional hazards regression and marginal structural modelling to assess the effect of contraceptive use on HIV-1 risk . FINDINGS Among 1314 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was female ( median follow-up 18?0 [ IQR 12?6-24?2 ] months ) , rates of HIV-1 acquisition were 6?61 per 100 person-years in women who used hormonal contraception and 3?78 per 100 person-years in those who did not ( adjusted hazard ratio 1?98 , 95 % CI 1?06-3?68 , p=0?03 ) . Among 2476 couples in which the HIV-1-seronegative partner was male ( median follow-up 18?7 [ IQR 12?8-24?2 ] months ) , rates of HIV-1 transmission from women to men were 2?61 per 100 person-years in couples in which women used hormonal contraception and 1?51 per 100 person-years in couples in which women did not use hormonal contraception ( adjusted hazard ratio 1?97 , 95 % CI 1?12-3?45 , p=0?02 ) . Marginal structural model analyses generated much the same results to the Cox proportional hazards regression . INTERPRETATION Women should be counselled about potentially increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission with hormonal contraception , especially injectable methods , and about the importance of dual protection with condoms to decrease HIV-1 risk . Non-hormonal or low-dose hormonal contraceptive methods should be considered for women with or at-risk for HIV-1 .
