<SOS> Cryoprobe biopsy increases the diagnostic yield in endobronchial tumor lesions . OBJECTIVE Forceps biopsy is the standard method to obtain specimens in endoscopically visible lesions . It is common to combine forceps biopsy with cytology methods to increase the diagnostic yield . Although the flexible cryoprobe has been established for bronchoscopic interventions in malignant stenosis , the obtained biopsies , called cryobiopsies , have not been investigated in a large cohort of patients . The aim of this feasibility study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic yield and safety of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy . METHODS During a 6-year period , 296 patients with visible endoluminal tumor lesions were included in the study at the bronchoscopy unit of a university hospital . In the first consecutively conducted 55 cases , both techniques , forceps biopsy and cryobiopsy , were applied simultaneously . Pathologic and quantitative image analyses were performed to evaluate the size and quality of the obtained specimens . We evaluated the safety and diagnostic yield to describe the feasibility of cryobiopsy . RESULTS Comparative analysis of the first conducted and randomly assigned 55 cases revealed a significantly higher diagnostic yield for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy ( 89.1 % vs 65.5 % , P < .05 ) . In this cohort , quantitative image analysis showed significantly larger biopsies regarding size and artifact-free tissue sections for cryobiopsy compared with forceps biopsy ( P < .0001 ) . The overall diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy was 89.5 % . Mild bleeding occurred in 11 cases ( 3.7 % ) , moderate bleeding occurred in 3 cases ( 1.0 % ) , and severe bleeding occurred in 1 case ( 0.3 % ) . CONCLUSION Cryobiopsy is safe and increases the diagnostic yield in endobronchial tumor lesions . The method also is feasible under routine conditions . <EOS>
