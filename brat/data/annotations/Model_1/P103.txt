<SOS> Randomized controlled study of chemoimmunotherapy with bestatin of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in adults . A new immunomodulating agent , bestatin ( INN : Ubenimex has low toxicity even after long-term oral administration and has significant modifications in immunological response . A cooperative randomized controlled study of bestatin immunotherapy in combination with remission maintenance chemotherapy for adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( ANLL ) was performed . After induction of complete remission , patients were randomized to the bestatin group ( 30 mg/bw per os ( po ) daily ) and the control group . The 101 eligible cases ( bestatin : 48 , control : 53 ) were analyzed ; the bestatin group achieved longer remission than the control group and a statistically significant longer survival . Though this prolongation of remission was not significant in the bestatin group compared to the control group in the 15-49 yr age group , in the 50-65 yr age group it was significantly longer . Bestatin is shown to be a clinically useful drug for immunotherapy of adult ANLL , since it has prolonged survival and remission especially in elderly patients , with few side-effects . <EOS>
