T10	o 865 930	plasma levels of epinephrine , norepinephrine , glucose , lactate
T11	o 1277 1796	Plasma catecholamine concentrations remained within the normal range during the investigation in patients subjected to general anaesthesia ( Groups 1-3 ) . Plasma catecholamines ( epinephrine and norepinephrine ) increased significantly in Group 4 ( retroauricular infiltration anaesthesia ) . There were no group variabilities with regard to MAP and HR . The plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine demonstrate a direct response to stress followed by a secondary change in glucose , lactate and free glycerol .
