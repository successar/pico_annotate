<SOS> Efficacy of intramuscular oxytetracycline as a dry cow treatment for Staphylococcus aureus mastitis . To determine the efficacy of intramuscular oxytetracycline as a supplemental dry cow treatment for Staphylococcus aureus mastitis , 37 Holstein cows were randomly assigned to two treatment groups : intracisternal infusion with a commercial preparation of cephapirin benzathine at drying off ( 20 cows ) and infusion with cephapirin benzathine at drying off and intramuscular oxytetracycline at 11 mg/kg once daily on d 7 , 8 , 9 , and 10 after drying off ( 17 cows ) . Milk samples collected 7 , 14 , 30 , and 60 d after calving were plated for bacterial isolation within 24 h after collection and after 24 to 72 h of storage at -20 degrees C. Quarters were defined as infected if S. aureus was isolated from the fresh and frozen cultures from any one sample collected before drying off . An infected quarter was defined as cured if S. aureus was not isolated from the fresh or frozen culture from milk samples obtained following calving . The rate of cure by 30 d after calving for systemic oxytetracycline ( in combination with cephapirin treatment ) was 29.4 % for infected quarters and 29.4 % for infected cows , compared with 27.5 and 25.0 % , respectively , for the cephapirin treatment only . Results including the culture at 60 d after calving were 21.2 and 22.5 % , respectively , for combination therapy and cephapirin therapy only . Systemic oxytetracycline , in combination with intramammary dry cow treatment , did not improve the rate of cure for S. aureus mastitis . <EOS>
