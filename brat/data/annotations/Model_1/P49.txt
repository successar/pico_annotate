<SOS> The safety of whey protein concentrate derived from the milk of cows immunized against Clostridium difficile . A whey protein concentrate prepared from the milk of cows that have been immunized against Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) and its toxins , toxin A and toxin B , is produced for use as a medical food for the dietary management of patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) to prevent a relapse of the infection . The safety of anti-C. difficile whey protein concentrate ( anti-CD WPC ) is supported by analytical data comparing the composition of raw milk from immunized cows versus that from non-immunized cows , and the composition of anti-CD WPC versus that of regular whey protein concentrate . Additionally , a prospective clinical study was conducted in 77 patients with CDAD to demonstrate the safety of consuming anti-CD WPC to prevent relapse of the infection . This study , which included adverse event monitoring , physical examinations , and extensive hematological and biochemical assessments , showed that anti-CD WPC is safe to consume by patients with CDAD . The available analytical and clinical evidence demonstrate that anti-CD WPC is safe for use by individuals with CDAD , under the described conditions of use . <EOS>
