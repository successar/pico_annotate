<SOS> The treatment of asthma in adults using sodium cromoglycate pressurized aerosol : a double-blind controlled trial . Sodium cromoglycate formulated as a pressurized aerosol ( 2 mg 4-times daily ) and placebo were compared in 31 adult asthmatic patients in a double-blind crossover trial lasting 12 weeks . Sodium cromoglycate was superior to placebo in improving breathlessness at rest ( p less than 0.001 ) , breathlessness on exertion ( p less than 0.05 ) and the quality of sleep ( p less than 0.001 ) , and also in improving the morning peak expiratory flow rate value ( p less than 0.05 ) . Both the patients ' ( p less than 0.05 ) and the clinicians ' ( p less than 0.01 ) treatment opinions , and their treatment preferences ( p less than 0.05 ) , favoured sodium cromoglycate . Moreover , usage of bronchodilators ( theophylline and aerosol beta-stimulants combined ) declined significantly ( p less than 0.001 ) during sodium cromoglycate treatment compared to placebo . No side-effects were reported . The results of this study show that sodium cromoglycate delivered by pressurized aerosol was significantly superior to placebo , not only in improving asthmatic symptoms , but also in reducing the amount of concomitant bronchodilator therapy required . <EOS>
