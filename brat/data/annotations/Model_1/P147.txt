<SOS> A New Interactive Screening Test for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Toddlers . OBJECTIVE To develop a clinically valid interactive level 2 screening assessment for autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) in toddlers that is brief , easily administered , and scored by clinicians . STUDY DESIGN We describe the development , training , standardization , and validation of the Rapid Interactive Screening Test for Autism in Toddlers ( RITA-T ) with ASD-specific diagnostic instruments . The RITA-T can be administered and scored in 10 minutes . We studied the validity of the RITA-T to distinguish between toddlers with ASD from toddlers with developmental delay ( DD ) /non-ASD in an early childhood clinic . We also evaluated the test 's performance in toddlers with no developmental concerns . We identified a cutoff score based on sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive value of the RITA-T that best differentiates between ASD and DD/non-ASD . RESULTS A total of 61 toddlers were enrolled . RITA-T scores were correlated with ASD-specific diagnostic tools ( r = 0.79 ; P < .01 ) and ASD clinical diagnoses ( r = 0.77 ; P < .01 ) . Mean scores were significantly different in subjects with ASD , those with DD/non-ASD , and those with no developmental concerns ( 20.8 vs 13 vs 10.6 , respectively ; P < .0001 ) . At a cutoff score of > 14 , the RITA-T had a sensitivity of 1.00 , specificity of 0.84 , and positive predictive value of 0.88 for identifying ASD risk in a high-risk group . CONCLUSION The RITA-T is a promising new level 2 interactive screening tool for improving the early identification of ASD in toddlers in general pediatric and early intervention settings and allowing access to treatment . <EOS>
