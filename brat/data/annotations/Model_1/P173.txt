<SOS> The effect of two types of teacher training on implementation of Smart Choices : a tobacco prevention curriculum . This study examined the implementation phase of a four-year research project to test the effectiveness of strategies to increase diffusion of Smart Choices , a school-based tobacco prevention program . The impact on curriculum implementation of two approaches to teacher training are compared . School districts were randomly assigned to a live workshop training or video training condition . The outcome of the evaluation was teachers ' implementation of Smart Choices . Results show a lower proportion of video-trained teachers implemented the curriculum , but overall completeness and fidelity of implementation for those teachers who did teach the curriculum were comparable for the two groups . Video-trained teachers , however , were less likely to use brainstorming and student presentations/role plays , two of the methods prescribed by the curriculum . Implications of the results for teacher training are discussed . <EOS>
