<SOS> Language outcome in autism : randomized comparison of joint attention and play interventions . This study reports results of a randomized controlled trial aimed at joint attention ( JA ) and symbolic play ( SP ) in preschool children with autism , with prediction to language outcome 12 months later . Participants were 58 children ( 46 boys ) with autism between 3 and 4 years of age . Children were randomized to a JA intervention , an SP intervention , or control group . Interventions were conducted 30 min daily for 5-6 weeks . Assessments of JA skills , SP skills , mother-child interactions , and language development were collected at 4 time points : pre- and postintervention and 6 and 12 months postintervention by independent testers . Results indicate that expressive language gains were greater for both treatment groups compared with the control group , and results could not be explained by differences in other interventions in which children participated . For children beginning treatment with the lowest language levels , the JA intervention improved language outcome significantly more than did the SP or control interventions . These findings suggest clinically significant benefits of actively treating JA and SP skills in young children with autism . <EOS>
