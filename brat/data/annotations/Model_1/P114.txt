<SOS> Effect of rosuvastatin monotherapy or in combination with fenofibrate or ?-3 fatty acids on lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome . BACKGROUND Raised triglycerides ( TG ) , decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) levels and a predominance of small dense low density lipoproteins ( sdLDL ) are characteristics of the metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . OBJECTIVE To compare the effect of high-dose rosuvastatin monotherapy with moderate dosing combined with fenofibrate or ?-3 fatty acids on the lipoprotein subfraction profile in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia and MetS . METHODS We previously randomised patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) > 160 and TG > 200 mg/dl to rosuvastatin monotherapy 40 mg/day ( R group , n = 30 ) or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day combined with fenofibrate 200 mg/day ( RF group , n = 30 ) or ?-3 fatty acids 2 g/day ( R? group , n = 30 ) . In the present study , only patients with MetS were included ( 24 , 23 and 24 in the R , RF and R? groups respectively ) . At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment , the lipoprotein subfraction profile was determined by polyacrylamide 3 % gel electrophoresis . RESULTS The mean LDL size was significantly increased in all groups . This change was more prominent with RF than with other treatments in parallel with its greater hypotriglyceridemic capacity ( p < 0.05 compared with R and R? ) . A decrease in insulin resistance by RF was also noted . Only RF significantly raised HDL-C levels ( by 7.7 % , p < 0.05 ) by increasing the cholesterol of small HDL particles . The cholesterol of larger HDL subclasses was significantly increased by R and R? . CONCLUSIONS All regimens increased mean LDL size ; RF was the most effective . A differential effect of treatments was noted on the HDL subfraction profile . <EOS>
