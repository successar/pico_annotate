<SOS> Parent-implemented enhanced milieu teaching with preschool children who have intellectual disabilities . PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of enhanced milieu teaching ( EMT ) implemented by parents and therapists versus therapists only on the language skills of preschool children with intellectual disabilities ( IDs ) , including children with Down syndrome and children with autism spectrum disorders . METHOD Seventy-seven children were randomly assigned to 2 treatments ( parent + therapist EMT or therapist-only EMT ) and received 36 intervention sessions . Children were assessed before , immediately after , 6 months after , and 12 months after intervention . Separate linear regressions were conducted for each standardized and observational measure at each time point . RESULTS Parents in the parent + therapist group demonstrated greater use of EMT strategies at home than untrained parents in the therapist-only group , and these effects maintained over time . Effect sizes for observational measures ranged from d = 0.10 to d = 1.32 favoring the parent + therapist group , with the largest effect sizes found 12 months after intervention . CONCLUSION Findings from this study indicate generally that there are benefits to training parents to implement naturalistic language intervention strategies with preschool children who have ID and significant language impairments . <EOS>
