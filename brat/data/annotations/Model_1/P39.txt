<SOS> Superior visual search in adults with autism . Recent studies have suggested that children with autism perform better than matched controls on visual search tasks and that this stems from a superior visual discrimination ability . This study assessed whether these findings generalize from children to adults with autism . Experiments 1 and 2 showed that , like children , adults with autism were superior to controls at searching for targets . Experiment 3 showed that increases in target-distractor similarity slowed the visual search performance of the control group significantly more than that of the autism group , suggesting that the adults with autism have a superior visual discrimination ability . Thus , these experiments replicate in adults previous findings in children with autism . Superior unique item detection in adults with autism , stemming from enhanced discrimination , is discussed in the light of the possible role of stimulus processing disturbances in the disorder in general . <EOS>
