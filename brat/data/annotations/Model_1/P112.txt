<SOS> RESPECT-PTSD : re-engineering systems for the primary care treatment of PTSD , a randomized controlled trial . BACKGROUND Although collaborative care is effective for treating depression and other mental disorders in primary care , there have been no randomized trials of collaborative care specifically for patients with Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . OBJECTIVE To compare a collaborative approach , the Three Component Model ( 3CM ) , with usual care for treating PTSD in primary care . DESIGN The study was a two-arm , parallel randomized clinical trial . PTSD patients were recruited from five primary care clinics at four Veterans Affairs healthcare facilities and randomized to receive usual care or usual care plus 3CM . Blinded assessors collected data at baseline and 3-month and 6-month follow-up . PARTICIPANTS Participants were 195 Veterans . Their average age was 45 years , 91 % were male , 58 % were white , 40 % served in Iraq or Afghanistan , and 42 % served in Vietnam . INTERVENTION All participants received usual care . Participants assigned to 3CM also received telephone care management . Care managers received supervision from a psychiatrist . MAIN MEASURES PTSD symptom severity was the primary outcome . Depression , functioning , perceived quality of care , utilization , and costs were secondary outcomes . KEY RESULTS There were no differences between 3CM and usual care in symptoms or functioning . Participants assigned to 3CM were more likely to have a mental health visit , fill an antidepressant prescription , and have adequate antidepressant refills . 3CM participants also had more mental health visits and higher outpatient pharmacy costs . CONCLUSIONS Results suggest the need for careful examination of the way that collaborative care models are implemented for treating PTSD , and for additional supports to encourage primary care providers to manage PTSD . <EOS>
