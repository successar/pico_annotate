<SOS> Vibrotactile -- auditory interactions are post-perceptual . Vibrotactile stimuli can elicit compelling auditory sensations , even when sound energy levels are minimal and undetectable . It has previously been shown that subjects judge auditory tones embedded in white noise to be louder when they are accompanied by a vibrotactile stimulus of the same frequency . A first experiment replicated this result at four different levels of auditory stimulation ( no tone , tone at detection threshold , tone at 5 dB above threshold , and tone at 10 dB above threshold ) . The presence of a vibrotactile stimulus induced an increase in the perceived loudness of auditory tones at three of the four values in this range . In two further experiments , a 2-interval forced-choice procedure was used to assess the nature of this cross-modal interaction . Subjects were biased when vibrotaction was applied in one interval , but applying vibrotaction in both intervals produced performance comparable to conditions without vibrotactile stimuli . This demonstrates that vibrotaction is sometimes ignored when judging the presence of an auditory tone . Hence the interaction between vibrotaction and audition does not appear to occur at an early perceptual level . <EOS>
