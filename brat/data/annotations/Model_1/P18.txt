<SOS> Oral contraceptive use is associated with increased cardiovascular reactivity in nonsmokers . Women who smoke and take oral contraceptives ( OCs ) have significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease , but the exact mechanismsfor the increased risk are not known . Cardiovascular reactivity to psychological stress may be one mechanism for the enhanced risk , but the small number of studies examining whether OC users who smoke have greater reactivity have produced mixed results . The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of chronic cigarette smoking , acute nicotine administration , and OC use on cardiovascular and lipid reactivity . Sixty healthy women , half of whom had been using OCs for at least the previous 6 months , participated in the study . Approximately two thirds were smokers and were randomized to be tested after either a 12-hr nicotine deprivation or administration of nicotine gum . One third were nonsmokers . Heart rate , blood pressure , and lipid measures were taken at rest , during a videotaped speech task , and during recovery from the task . Results indicated that , among OC nonusers , there was no effect of smoking status or nicotine administration on cardiovascular reactivity . However , among OC users , nonsmokers had significantly greater heart rate and diastolic blood pressure reactivity to stress . These data show that acute nicotine administration , in the form of nicotine gum , has no effect on cardiovascular or lipid stress reactivity in women . However OC use among nonsmoking women is associated with greater cardiovascular reactivity to stress . <EOS>
