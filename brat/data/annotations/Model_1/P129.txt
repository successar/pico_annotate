<SOS> The effect of four different irrigation systems in the removal of a root canal sealer . OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of sonic , ultrasonic , and hydrodynamic devices in the removal of a root canal sealer from the surface and from simulated irregularities of root canals . MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-three root canals with two standardized grooves in the apical and coronal parts of longitudinally split roots were covered with AH Plus root canal sealer . Compared were the effects of ( control ) syringe irrigation , ( 1 ) CanalBrush , ( 2 ) passive ultrasonic irrigation , ( 3 ) EndoActivator , and ( 4 ) RinsEndo on the removal of the sealer . The specimens were divided into four groups ( N = 12 ) and one control group ( N = 5 ) via randomization . The amount of remaining sealer in the root canal irregularities was evaluated under a microscope using a 4-grade scoring system , whereas the remaining sealer on the root canal surface was evaluated with a 7-grade scoring system . RESULTS Passive ultrasonic irrigation is more effective than the other tested irrigation systems or syringe irrigation in removing sealer from root canal walls ( p < 0.01 ) . None of the techniques had a significant effect on cleaning the lateral grooves . CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of this study protocol ultrasonic irrigation shows a superior effect on sealer removal from the root canal surface during endodontic retreatment . Cleaning of lateral grooves seems not to be possible with one of the techniques investigated . CLINICAL RELEVANCE Incomplete removal of root canal sealer during re-treatment may cause treatment failure . Passive Ultrasonic irrigation seems to be the most effective system to remove sealer from a root canal . <EOS>
