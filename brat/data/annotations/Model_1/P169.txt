<SOS> [ Double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness and tolerability of 10 and 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine suppositories in post-cholecystectomy pain ] . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg and 30 mg suppositories in comparison to placebo , after single dose administration in patients suffering from post-operative pain after cholecystectomy . DESIGN Double-blind , randomized , controlled study . SETTING Anaesthesia Service . PATIENTS 99 patients with severe pain following surgery . INTERVENTIONS Cholecystectomy . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The analgesia activity of ketorolac tromethamine 10 mg and 30 mg suppositories were evaluated after single dose administration by assessing pain intensity and pain relief using a 4 point scale ( VRS ) . At the end of the treatment period overall assessment of safety and efficacy were recorded by physician and patient . The results show that in both active groups after 30 ' and until 4 hours , pain intensity decreased significantly with respect to the baseline . However a statistically significant difference between groups of p < 0.02 , p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 was found in favour of the 30 mg dose respectively at 30 ' , 6 and 8 hours after administration . All the patients treated with placebo suppositories required another rescue analgesic drug and withdrew from the trial . Three patients complained adverse events not related to treatment : two on placebo and one on ketorolac 10 mg . The systemic and local tolerability of the drug was good . CONCLUSIONS This study shows that ketorolac 30 mg suppositories are effective in clinical conditions , such as after surgery , in which pain control must be achieved within the shortest time interval and maintained or improved by means of a single route of administration . <EOS>
