T1	p 198 258	atheroma progression in patients with spotty calcification .
T2	p 631 944	total of 1,347 stable patients with angiographic coronary artery disease underwent serial evaluation of atheroma burden with intravascular ultrasound imaging . Patients with spotty calcification were identified based on the presence of lesions ( 1 to 4 mm in length ) containing an arc of calcification of < 90? .
T3	p 1008 1557	between patients with spotty calcification ( n = 922 ) and those with no calcification ( n = 425 ) . RESULTS Patients with spotty calcification were older ( age 56 years vs. 54 years ; p = 0.001 ) , more likely to be male ( 68 % vs. 54 % ; p = 0.01 ) , and have a history of diabetes mellitus ( 30 % vs. 24 % ; p = 0.01 ) and myocardial infarction ( 28 % vs. 20 % ; p = 0.004 ) , and have lower on-treatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ( 48 ? 16 mg/dl vs. 51 ? 17 mg/dl ; p = 0.001 ) . Patients with spotty calcification demonstrated
