<SOS> A novel approach to the use of subgingival controlled-release chlorhexidine delivery in chronic periodontitis : a randomized clinical trial . BACKGROUND We aimed to analyze clinical , microbiologic , and serologic effects of chlorhexidine ( CHX ) chips used as a subgingival controlled-release delivery device before and immediately after scaling and root planing ( SRP ) . METHODS Twenty-four patients presenting with ?12 teeth with probing depth ( PD ) ?5 mm and bleeding on probing were assigned in test or control groups . After prophylaxis , CHX chips ( test ) or placebo chips ( control ) were placed in pockets with PD ?5 mm . Ten days later , SRP was performed in all teeth with PD ?4 mm in a single appointment . Immediately after SRP , new chips were inserted in all pockets with PD ?5 mm . Parameters were assessed at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and 1 , 3 , and 6 months after treatment . Subgingival samples were obtained at baseline ; beginning of SRP ; and at 1 month after treatment . Periodontal pathogens Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Prevotella intermedia , Tannerella forsythia , and Treponema denticola were analyzed . Serum levels of high sensitive C-reactive and lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins were measured . The changes of the parameters between and within the groups were tested by Mann-Whitney U test ( P < 0.05 ) . RESULTS All clinical and serologic parameters improved in both groups over time . There was a significant difference in clinical attachment level ( CAL ) gain from baseline to 6 months between groups ( 1.17 mm in the test group versus 0.79 mm in the placebo group ) ( P < 0.05 ) . The treatment with CHX chips showed a greater reduction of the microorganisms of the red complex after 1 month ( P = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSION The use of CHX chips before and immediately after SRP improved CAL and reduced the subgingival microorganisms of the red complex in the treatment of chronic periodontitis . <EOS>
