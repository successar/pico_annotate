<SOS> A selective angiotensin receptor antagonist , Valsartan , produced regression of left ventricular hypertrophy associated with a reduction of arterial stiffness . We investigated whether a selective angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) would have a regressive effect on left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) . In a double-blind study , 24 CAPD patients with LVH [ left ventricular mass index ( LVMi ) > 110 g/m2 for women and LVMi > 137 g/m2 for men ] were randomized to 12 months ' administration of either the ARB valsartan ( n = 14 ) or a placebo ( n = 10 ) . The target blood pressure ( BP ) was 140/90 mmHg or lower in both groups . The following parameters were measured before and at the end of the study : aortic and large-artery compliance and arterial wave reflections [ pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) and augmentation index ( AI ) application tonometry ] and cardiac echocardiography . Periodically recorded were body weight , BP ( mercury sphygmomanometer ) , serum creatinine , electrolytes , complete blood cell counts , urine volume , drainage volume , and weekly creatinine clearance . Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis . Systolic and diastolic BP were both reduced in patients treated with ARB . The LVMi was significantly reduced in patients treated with ARB ( to 121 +/- 4 from 145 +/- 5 ) but not in those receiving placebo ( to 137 +/- 3 from 152 +/- 3 , p < 0.05 ) . The decrease in LVMi was associated with a reduction in PWV and AI . In CAPD patients with LVH , ARB reduced LVMi in association with alterations in arterial hemodynamics . <EOS>
