<SOS> A randomized comparison of alternative techniques to achieve coronary sinus cannulation during biventricular implantation procedures . INTRODUCTION Biventricular pacing system implantation is a time-consuming and challenging procedure . A critical step in biventricular pacemaker implantation is coronary sinus ( CS ) cannulation . CS cannulation can be achieved either using dedicated guiding catheters ( guiding catheter alone positioning strategy , GCA ) or with the aid of an electrophysiology catheter advanced inside the guiding catheter ( electrophysiology catheter aided positioning strategy , EPA ) . AIM OF THE STUDY To evaluate whether the EPA technique is useful for reducing CS cannulation time compared to a conventional GCA technique . METHODS Thirty-four consecutive patients were randomly assigned to the GCA ( 18 patients ) or EPA ( 16 patients ) CS cannulation strategy . RESULTS Time to successful catheterization of CS was 5.0 +/- 2.4 min in the EPA group versus 10.1 +/- 5.4 min in the GCA group p = 0.004 . Fluoroscopy time was 4.6 +/- 2.3 min in the EPA group versus 9.2 +/- 4.9 min in the GCA group p = 0.004 . Total contrast dye volume to search and engage the CS ostium was 0.0 ml in the EPA group versus 14.3 +/- 3.4 ml in the GCA group p < 0.001 . CONCLUSIONS Cannulation of CS with the adjunct of an electrophysiology catheter to dedicated delivery systems significantly reduces procedural time , fluoroscopy time and contrast dye volume compared to a conventional strategy . <EOS>
