<SOS> Effects of cuff inflation on self-recorded blood pressure . Changes in continuously recorded 'Finapres ' finger blood pressure in ten normotensive and seven hypertensive subjects induced by self-inflation of the cuff or just wearing the inflated cuff were studied . Inflating the cuff caused an instantaneous rise in systolic blood pressure of 13 and 12 mm Hg ( hypertensive and normotensive subjects , respectively ) . Wearing the inflated cuff did not change blood pressure . Thus the rise in pressure was related to the muscular activity required for cuff inflation . Systolic blood pressure took on average 7 s and at most 21 s to return to baseline level after stopping cuff inflation . Since first Korotkoff sounds may already be heard after 10-15 s when following recommended procedures , self-recorded systolic blood pressure may be recorded as too high when subjects inflate their cuff at too low a pressure or deflate it too fast . <EOS>
