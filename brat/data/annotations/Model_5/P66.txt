<SOS> Comparison of propofol , droperidol , and metoclopramide for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting after breast cancer surgery : a prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in Japanese patients . BACKGROUND Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) . Between 60 % and 80 % of patients who undergo mastectomy ( with axillary dissection ) experience PONV . We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg/kg was more effective than placebo in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy . OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients . METHODS In this prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg/kg , droperidol 20 microg/kg , metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg , or placebo ( isotonic saline ) immediately after skin suture . A standard general anesthetic technique , including sevoflurane and air in oxygen , was used . All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment . The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms . To maintain the integrity of the study results , none of the patients received preanesthetic medication . RESULTS A total of 100 women ( mean [ SD ] age , 52 [ 7 ] years ; height , 154 [ 6 ] cm ; weight , 54 [ 7 ] kg ) were included in the study . Each study group comprised 25 patients . There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics , surgery type , or awakening time . The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28 % with propofol ( P = 0.005 ) , 32 % with droperidol ( P = 0.011 ) , and 60 % with metoclopramide ( P = NS ) , compared with placebo ( 68 % ) . No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol , and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with metoclopramide ( P = 0.022 and P = 0.043 , respectively ) . Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups . CONCLUSIONS The prevalences of PONV were not significantly different between propofol 0.5 mg/kg and droperidol 20 microg/kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small , select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery . The prevalences of PONV were significantly lower with propofol and droperidol compared with metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg and placebo . <EOS>
