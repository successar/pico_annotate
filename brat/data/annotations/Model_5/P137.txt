<SOS> A randomized controlled study of a social skills training for preadolescent children with autism spectrum disorders : generalization of skills by training parents and teachers ? BACKGROUND Social skills training ( SST ) is a common intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) to improve their social and communication skills . Despite the fact that SSTs are often applied in clinical practice , the evidence for the effectiveness of these trainings for children with ASD is inconclusive . Moreover , long term outcome and generalization of learned skills are little evaluated . Additionally , there is no research on the influence of involvement of parents and teachers on effectiveness of SST and on the generalization of learned social skills to daily life . We expect parent and teacher involvement in SST to enhance treatment efficacy and to facilitate generalization of learned skills to daily life . METHOD/DESIGN In a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) with three conditions , 120 participants with ASD at the end of primary school ( 10-12 years of calendar age ) have been randomized to SST , SST-PTI ( SST with Parent & Teacher Involvement ) , or care-as-usual . The SST consists of 18 group sessions of 1.5 hours for the children . In the SST-PTI condition , parents additionally participate in 8 parent sessions and parents and teachers are actively involved in homework assignments . Assessment takes place at three moments : before and immediately after the intervention period and at 6 months follow-up . Primary outcome is socialization , as an aspect of adaptive functioning . Secondary outcomes focus on specific social skills children learn during SST and on more general social skills pertaining to home and community settings from a multi-informant perspective . Additionally , possible predictors of treatment outcome will be assessed . DISCUSSION The current study is an RCT study evaluating SST in a large sample of Dutch children with ASD in a specific age range ( 10-12 years ) . Strengths of the study are the use of one manualized protocol , application of standardized and internationally used rating instruments , use of multiple raters , investigation of generalization of learned skills to daily life , and the evaluation of efficacy in the longer term by follow-up measures at 6 months after the end of training .
