<SOS> A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial of the impact on quality of life of continuing dexamethasone beyond 24 h following adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . Uncertainty remains about the optimal anti-emetic regimen for control of delayed nausea and vomiting after adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer . Many patients receive dexamethasone but complain of insomnia , anxiety/agitation , and indigestion . The aim was to determine if patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer prefer treatment with dexamethasone or placebo for prophylaxis against delayed nausea and vomiting , and to compare quality of life ( QOL ) between the two treatments . In this randomized , double-blind , cross-over trial , we compared oral dexamethasone ( 4 mg twice daily for 2 days ) versus placebo for chemotherapy-na?ve patients with breast cancer . All patients received intravenous granisetron and dexamethasone pre-chemotherapy and oral granisetron on day 2 . Primary endpoints were : ( i ) patient preference ; ( ii ) difference between cycles in change of QOL from days 1 to 8 . Median age of the 94 women was 51 years ( range 27-76 ) : 79 received fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide and 15 received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide . Thirteen withdrew pre-cycle 2 with no differences between arms . Of 80 patients stating a preference , 31 preferred placebo ( 39 % , 95 % CI : 28-50 % ) and 37 ( 46 % , 95 % CI : 35-58 % ) preferred dexamethasone ; 12 had no preference . There were no differences in intensity of vomiting , nausea , or time to onset of vomiting . There was greater decrease in global QOL ( p = 0.06 ) when patients received dexamethasone . No other symptom/QOL domains differed significantly . In conclusion , no significant difference was found in patient preference , QOL , or symptoms regardless of whether dexamethasone or placebo was used after adjuvant chemotherapy . <EOS>
