<SOS> Data mining the ScanBrit study of a gluten- and casein-free dietary intervention for children with autism spectrum disorders : behavioural and psychometric measures of dietary response . We previously reported results based on the examination of a gluten- and casein-free diet as an intervention for children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as part of the ScanBrit collaboration . Analysis based on grouped results indicated several significant differences between dietary and non-dietary participants across various core and peripheral areas of functioning . Results also indicated some disparity in individual responses to dietary modification potentially indicative of responder and non-responder differences . Further examination of the behavioural and psychometric data garnered from participants was undertaken , with a view to determining potential factors pertinent to response to dietary intervention . Participants with clinically significant scores indicative of inattention and hyperactivity behaviours and who had a significant positive changes to said scores were defined as responders to the dietary intervention . Analyses indicated several factors to be potentially pertinent to a positive response to dietary intervention in terms of symptom presentation . Chronological age was found to be the strongest predictor of response , where those participants aged between 7 and 9 years seemed to derive most benefit from dietary intervention . Further analysis based on the criteria for original study inclusion on the presence of the urine compound , trans-indolyl-3-acryloylglycine may also merit further investigation . These preliminary observations on potential best responder characteristics to a gluten- and casein-free diet for children with autism require independent replication . <EOS>
