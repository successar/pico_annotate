<SOS> Intervention to lower household wood smoke exposure in Guatemala reduces ST-segment depression on electrocardiograms . BACKGROUND A large body of evidence suggests that fine particulate matter ( PM ) air pollution is a cause of cardiovascular disease , but little is known in particular about the cardiovascular effects of indoor air pollution from household use of solid fuels in developing countries . RESPIRE ( Randomized Exposure Study of Pollution Indoors and Respiratory Effects ) was a randomized trial of a chimney woodstove that reduces wood smoke exposure . OBJECTIVES We tested the hypotheses that the stove intervention , compared with open fire use , would reduce ST-segment depression and increase heart rate variability ( HRV ) . METHODS We used two complementary study designs : a ) between-groups comparisons based on randomized stove assignment , and b ) before-and-after comparisons within control subjects who used open fires during the trial and received chimney stoves after the trial . Electrocardiogram sessions that lasted 20 hr were repeated up to three times among 49 intervention and 70 control women 38-84 years of age , and 55 control subjects were also assessed after receiving stoves . HRV and ST-segment values were assessed for each 30-min period . ST-segment depression was defined as an average value below -1.00 mm . Personal fine PM [ aerodynamic diameter ? 2.5 ?m ( PM?.? ] exposures were measured for 24 hr before each electrocardiogram . RESULTS PM?.? exposure means were 266 and 102 ?g/m? during the trial period in the control and intervention groups , respectively . During the trial , the stove intervention was associated with an odds ratio of 0.26 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0.08-0.90 ) for ST-segment depression . We found similar associations with the before-and-after comparison . The intervention was not significantly associated with HRV . CONCLUSIONS The stove intervention was associated with reduced occurrence of nonspecific ST-segment depression , suggesting that household wood smoke exposures affect ventricular repolarization and potentially cardiovascular health . <EOS>
