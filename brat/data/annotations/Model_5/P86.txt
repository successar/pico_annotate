<SOS> [ Efficacy of paliperidone extended-release tablets in the improvement of social functions in schizophrenics : a randomized and controlled study ] . OBJECTIVE To explore the efficacy of paliperidone extended-release tablets in the improvement of social functions in schizophrenics . METHODS A total of 81 schizophrenics were randomly divided into study group with paliperidone extended-release tablets and control group with risperidone for a 12-week treatment . They were assessed and analyzed by positive and negative symptoms scales ( PANSS ) , social disability screening schedule ( SDSS ) and treatment emergent symptom scale ( TESS ) at baseline , 6 ( th ) weekend and 12 ( th ) weekend . RESULTS In study group , the factors and total scores of PANSS in the 12 ( th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 12.0 ? 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ? 3.6 ) , ( 26.2 ? 5.0 ) , ( 50.2 ? 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those at baseline [ ( 24.7 ? 5.3 ) , ( 23.8 ? 3.6 ) , ( 45.0 ? 2.9 ) , ( 93.5 ? 6.8 ) ] ( t = 9.60-16.78 , P < 0.05 ) . In study group , the positive factor , negative factor and total scores of PANSS in the 12 ( th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 12.0 ? 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ? 3.6 ) , ( 50.2 ? 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those in the 6 ( th ) weekend of treatment [ ( 14.2 ? 1.8 ) , ( 14.6 ? 2.4 ) , ( 56.5 ? 6.4 ) ] ( t = 2.58-4.26 , P < 0.05 ) . In the 12 ( th ) weekend of treatment , the factors and total scores of PANSS in study group [ ( 12.0 ? 2.8 ) , ( 12.1 ? 3.6 ) , ( 26.2 ? 5.0 ) , ( 50.2 ? 8.7 ) ] were all significantly lower than those in control group [ ( 16.9 ? 4.9 ) , ( 18.7 ? 5.3 ) , ( 32.5 ? 5.1 ) , ( 68.1 ? 13.0 ) ] ( t = -4.28 -- 5.67 , P < 0.05 ) . In study group , the total scores of SDSS in the 12 ( th ) weekend of treatment ( 5.93 ? 2.78 ) were significantly lower than those at baseline ( 13.9 ? 3.4 ) ( t = 10.83 , P < 0.05 ) . In study group , the total scores of SDSS in the 12 ( th ) weekend of treatment ( 5.9 ? 2.8 ) were significantly lower than those in the 6 ( th ) weekend of treatment ( 7.6 ? 2.9 ) ( t = 5.21 , P < 0.05 ) . But there was no significant improvement in control group ( t = 1.88 , P > 0.05 ) . In the 12 ( th ) weekend of treatment , the total scores of SDSS in study group ( 5.9 ? 2.8 ) were significantly lower than those in control group ( 8.8 ? 2.9 ) ( t = -4.49 , P < 0.05 ) . No severe adverse effect was reported in either group . CONCLUSION Paliperidone extended-release tablets are effective to improve social functions and psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenics . <EOS>
