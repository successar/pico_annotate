<SOS> Sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography : a randomized controlled study of patient-controlled propofol sedation and that given by a nurse anesthetist . OBJECTIVE Different regimens are used for sedation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Our objectives were to compare safety , ease of treatment , recovery , and patients ' experiences using patient-controlled sedation ( PCS ) with propofol , nurse anesthetist-controlled sedation ( ACS ) , or the department 's standard of care , midazolam given by the procedure team ( control group ) . MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 281 adults in 301 procedures . The PCS group ( n = 101 ) delivered bolus doses of 5 mg of propofol according to their need for sedation . The ACS group ( n = 100 ) had 2-8 mg/kg/h of propofol infused , with the target for sedation being level 3 of the Observer 's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation ( OAA/S ) scale . The control group was given 2-3 mg of midazolam for induction and additional 1 mg if required . RESULTS PCS and ACS increased the ease of the procedure and reduced the number of sedation failures compared to midazolam sedation ( ACS n = 0 ; PCS n = 4 ; midazolam n = 20 ) . The ACS group had more deeply sedated patients ( OAA/S level 2 ) , desaturation , and obstructed airways than the PCS and midazolam groups . Time to full recovery ( Aldrete score ?9 ) was shortest following PCS . PCS resulted in the least fatigue and pain after the procedure . Patients ' preference for PCS and ACS was the same . CONCLUSION PCS with propofol is superior to midazolam and comparable to ACS . PCS resulted in a rapid recovery , fewer respiratory events , and was almost as effective as ACS in ensuring a successful examination . <EOS>
