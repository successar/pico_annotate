<SOS> In school-aged children a combination of galacto-oligosaccharides and Lactobacillus GG increases bifidobacteria more than Lactobacillus GG on its own . The aim of this study was to compare a combination of Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) and galacto-oligosaccharides ( GOS ) with LGG on its own , and their effects on the intestinal microbiota in school-aged children . The randomized , double-blinded , crossover study comprised 30 healthy children . There were two 3-week study periods with a 4-week wash-out period in between . The children ingested daily 65 ml of milk-based fruit juice containing either LGG alone ( 6.5 x 10 ( 9 ) CFU ) or LGG plus 2 g of GOS . Symptom diaries were filled during the study periods . Fecal samples were collected at the beginning and end of both study periods . At the end of both study periods , the amount of bifidobacteria was significantly greater after the ingestion of LGG + GOS compared with LGG alone ( geometric mean 9.33 x 10 ( 9 ) vs. 4.28 x 10 ( 9 ) CFU/g , p < 0.001 ) . No significant differences were seen in the amount of lactobacilli or LGG , nor did gastrointestinal symptoms , defecation frequency , consistency of stools or ease of defecation differ between the two study periods . Ingestion of LGG combined with 2 g of GOS increased the bifidobacteria more than LGG on its own and thus GOS clearly has a prebiotic effect in children . The children tolerated well a daily intake of 2 g of GOS . <EOS>
