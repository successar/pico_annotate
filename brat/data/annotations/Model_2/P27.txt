<SOS> Phase III study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma : positive effect on overall and progression-free survival . PURPOSE Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is a radiosensitive and chemosensitive tumor . This randomized phase III trial compared concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) versus radiotherapy ( RT ) alone in patients with advanced NPC . PATIENTS AND METHODS From December 1993 to April 1999 , 284 patients with 1992 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III to IV ( M0 ) NPC were randomly allocated into two arms . Similar dosage and fractionation of RT was administered in both arms . The investigational arm received two cycles of concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin 20 mg/m ( 2 ) /d plus fluorouracil 400 mg/m ( 2 ) /d by 96-hour continuous infusion during the weeks 1 and 5 of RT . Survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test . RESULTS Baseline patient characteristics were comparable in both arms . After a median follow-up of 65 months , 26.2 % ( 37 of 141 ) and 46.2 % ( 66 of 143 ) of patients developed tumor relapse in the CCRT and RT-alone groups , respectively . The 5-year overall survival rates were 72.3 % for the CCRT arm and 54.2 % for the RT-only arm ( P =.0022 ) . The 5-year progression-free survival rates were 71.6 % for the CCRT group compared with 53.0 % for the RT-only group ( P =.0012 ) . Although significantly more toxicity was noted in the CCRT arm , including leukopenia and emesis , compliance with the combined treatment was good . The second cycle of concurrent chemotherapy was refused by nine patients and was delayed for > or = 1 week for another nine patients . There were no treatment-related deaths in either arm . CONCLUSION We conclude that CCRT is superior to RT alone for patients with advanced NPC in endemic areas . <EOS>
