<SOS> A randomised controlled trial of personalised decision support delivered via the internet for bowel cancer screening with a faecal occult blood test : the effects of tailoring of messages according to social cognitive variables on participation . BACKGROUND In Australia , bowel cancer screening participation using faecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) is low . Decision support tailored to psychological predictors of participation may increase screening . The study compared tailored computerised decision support to non-tailored computer or paper information . The primary outcome was FOBT return within 12 weeks . Additional analyses were conducted on movement in decision to screen and change on psychological variables . METHODS A parallel , randomised controlled , trial invited 25,511 people aged 50-74 years to complete an eligibility questionnaire . Eligible respondents ( n = 3,408 ) were assigned to Tailored Personalised Decision Support ( TPDS ) , Non-Tailored PDS ( NTPDS ) , or Control ( CG ) ( intention-to-treat , ITT sample ) . TPDS and NTPDS groups completed an on-line baseline survey ( BS ) and accessed generic information . The TPDS group additionally received a tailored intervention . CG participants completed a paper BS only . Those completing the BS ( n = 2270 ) were mailed an FOBT and requested to complete an endpoint survey ( ES ) that re-measured BS variables ( per-protocol , PP sample ) . RESULTS FOBT return : In the ITT sample , there was no significant difference between any group ( ? ( 2 ) ( 2 ) = 2.57 , p = .26 ; TPDS , 32.5 % ; NTPDS , 33 % ; and CG , 34.5 % ) . In the PP sample , FOBT return in the internet groups was significantly higher than the paper group ( ? ( 2 ) ( 2 ) = 17.01 , p < .001 ; TPDS , 80 % ; NTPDS , 83 % ; and CG , 74 % ) . FOBT completion by TPDS and NTPDS did not differ ( ? ( 2 ) ( 1 ) = 2.23 , p = .13 ) . Age was positively associated with kit return . Decision to screen : 2227/2270 of the PP sample provided complete BS data . Participants not wanting to screen at baseline ( 1083/2227 ) and allocated to TPDS and NTPDS were significantly more likely to decide to screen and return an FOBT than those assigned to the CG . FOBT return by TPDS and NTPDS did not differ from one another ( OR = 1.16 , p = .42 ) . Change on psychosocial predictors : Analysis of change indicated that salience and coherence of screening and self-efficacy were improved and faecal aversion decreased by tailored messaging . CONCLUSIONS Online information resources may have a role in encouraging internet-enabled people who are uncommitted to screening to change their attitudes , perceptions and behaviour .
