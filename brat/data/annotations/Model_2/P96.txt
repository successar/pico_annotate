<SOS> A physiotherapy service to an emergency extended care unit does not decrease admission rates to hospital : a randomised trial . BACKGROUND One of the reasons physiotherapy services are provided to emergency departments ( EDs ) and emergency extended care units ( EECUs ) is to review patients ' mobility to ensure they are safe to be discharged home . AIM To investigate whether a physiotherapy service to an EECU altered the rate of hospital admission , rate of re-presentation to the ED , visits to community healthcare practitioners , return to usual work/home/leisure activities and patient satisfaction . METHODS A randomised trial with concealed allocation , assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken in an EECU . The sample comprised 186 patients ( mean age 70 years , 123 ( 66 % ) female patients , 130 ( 70 % ) trauma ) who were referred for physiotherapy assessment/intervention . Referral occurred at any stage of the patients ' EECU admission . All participants received medical/nursing care as required . The physiotherapy group also received physiotherapy assessment/intervention . RESULTS The physiotherapy group had a 4 % ( 95 % CI -18 % to 9 % ) lower rate of admission to hospital than the control group and a 4 % ( 95 % CI -6 % to 13 % ) higher rate of re-presentation to the ED , which were statistically non-significant ( p?0.45 ) . Differences between groups for use of community healthcare resources , return to usual work/home/leisure activities and satisfaction with their EECU care were small and not significant . CONCLUSION A physiotherapy service for EECU patients , as provided in this study , did not reduce the rate of hospital admission , rate of re-presentation to the ED , use of community healthcare resources , or improve the rate of return to usual work/home/leisure activities or patient satisfaction .
