<SOS> An open-label extension study of the safety and efficacy of risperidone in children and adolescents with autistic disorder . OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of risperidone in treating irritability and related behaviors in children and adolescents with autistic disorders . METHODS In this 6 month ( 26 week ) open-label extension ( OLE ) study , patients ( 5-17 years of age , who completed the previous fixed-dose , 6 week , double-blind [ DB ] phase ) were flexibly dosed with risperidone based on body weight . The maximum allowed dose was 1.25 mg/day for those weighing 20 to < 45 kg , and 1.75 mg/day for those weighing ? 45 kg . The study primarily assessed risperidone 's safety ; efficacy was assessed as a secondary end-point . RESULTS Fifty-six ( 71 % ) out of 79 enrolled patients completed the OLE ; the most common discontinuations were for insufficient response ( 7 [ 9 % ] ) or adverse events ( AE ) ( 5 [ 6 % ] ) . The most common ( ? 5 % frequency in the total group ) AEs were increased appetite ( 11 % [ n=9 ] ) ; increased weight and vomiting ( 9 % [ n=7 ] each ) ; sedation , pyrexia , and upper respiratory tract infection ( 8 % [ n=6 ] each ) ; nasopharyngitis ( 6 % [ n=5 ] ) ; and somnolence and fatigue ( 5 % [ n=4 ] each ) . Extrapyramidal AEs were reported in 6 ( 8 % ) patients . Increase in mean weight ( 11-15 % ) and body mass index ( 5-10 % ) occurred ; one patient discontinued because of weight increase . One potentially prolactin-related AE ( irregular menstruation ) was reported . The risperidone high-dose group had the greatest mean improvement in sleep visual analog scale ( 24.6 ) . All groups showed additional improvement in efficacy scale scores during the OLE . CONCLUSIONS During this OLE , safety findings with risperidone treatment ( maximum weight-based dose of 1.25 mg/day or 1.75 mg/day ) were consistent with those observed in the DB phase , and with the current safety information for risperidone in autistic , psychiatric , and behavioral disorders . Patients experienced some additional improvement in irritability and related behaviors . CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY This phase-4 study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT00576732 ) . <EOS>
