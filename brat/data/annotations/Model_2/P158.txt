<SOS> Rapid tightening of blood glucose control leads to transient deterioration of retinopathy in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus : the Oslo study . In a study of retinopathy during one year of tight blood glucose control 45 type I ( insulin dependent ) diabetics without proliferative retinopathy were randomised to receive either continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion , multiple insulin injections , or conventional insulin treatment ( controls ) . Near normoglycaemia was achieved with continuous infusion and multiple injections but not with conventional treatment . Blind evaluation of fluorescein angiograms performed three monthly showed progression of retinopathy in the control group , transient deterioration in the continuous infusion group , and no change in the multiple injection group . Half the patients receiving continuous infusion and multiple injections developed retinal cotton wool spots after three to six months . These changes regressed in all but four patients after 12 months . Control patients did not develop cotton wool spots . Patients who developed cotton wool spots are characterised by a larger decrement in glycosylated haemoglobin and blood glucose values , more frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia , a longer duration of diabetes , and more severe retinopathy at onset . A large and rapid fall in blood glucose concentration may promote transient deterioration of diabetic retinopathy . <EOS>
