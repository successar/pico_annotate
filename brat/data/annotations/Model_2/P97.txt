<SOS> Cancer information and anxiety : applying the extended parallel process model . There is concern that public education about testicular cancer ( TC ) may cause unnecessary anxiety . Psychological theory suggests that if threat ( eg , TC ) information is accompanied with threat control strategies ( eg , testicular self-examination ; TSE ) anxiety is less likely . Male students ( N=443 ) were randomized to either a TC or TC +TSE information group or a no information control group , and assessed at three time points . Anxiety levels did not differ between the groups and exposure to TC+TSE resulted in greater perceived message benefit , increased intention to self-examine and lower message denigration . This suggests TC information is not anxiogenic , but inclusion of TSE information may improve acceptance of disease awareness information . <EOS>
