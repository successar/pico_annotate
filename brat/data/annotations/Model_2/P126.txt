<SOS> [ Impact of CCND1 A870G polymorphism on acute adverse events in postoperative rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy ] . OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) of CCND1 A870G and acute adverse events ( AEs ) in postoperative rectal cancer patients who received capecitabine-based postoperative chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) . METHODS Four hundred patients with stage II and III rectal cancer received postoperative CRT of capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin were accumulated and prostectively studied in this study . The patients were randomly divided into two groups . Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were treated with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy ( Cap-CRT ) , and 172 patients were treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin plus radiotherapy ( Cap-Oxa-CRT ) . Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , v. 3.0 ( CTCAE v3.0 ) . The genotype of CCND1 A870G in the patients was detected by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) analysis . The associations between the SNP and acute AEs were indicated by odds ratios ( ORs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) , which were computed with logistic regression model . RESULTS A total of 136 patients presented severe AEs . Among them the frequencies of the three genotypes GG , GA and AA were 16.9 % , 50.7 % and 32.4 % , compared with 24.6 % , 48.1 % and 27.3 % , respectively , among the patients without severe AEs . Diarrhea was the most common AE , and severe diarrhea occurred in 109 patients . The frequencies of the three genotypes GG , GA and AA were 15.6 % , 47.7 % and 36.7 % among these patients , compared with 24.4 % , 49.5 % and 26.1 % , respectively , among patients without severe diarrhea . Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a 1.66-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea in patients with AA genotype ( 95 % CI 1.03 - 2.67 , P = 0.038 ) compared with the cases with GG or GA genotypes . Stratified analysis showed that in the Cap-Oxa-CRT group , patients with AA genotype showed a 2.34-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea ( 95 % CI 1.16 - 4.76 , P = 0.018 ) compared with those with GG or GA genotypes , but in the Cap-CRT group , the SNP was not associated with the risk of severe diarrhea . CONCLUSIONS The genetic polymorphism of CCND1 A870G might be a potential biomarker for predicting acute AEs in postoperative stage II and III rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin . <EOS>
