<SOS> Why were the results of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ( HOPE ) trial so astounding ? The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation ( HOPE ) study was important because it showed the benefits of ramipril - an angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor - in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events . Treatment with ramipril significantly reduced the rates of death , myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary revascularization , cardiac arrest and heart failure , as well as the risk of diabetes-related complications and of diabetes itself . The effects of therapy with vitamin E were also evaluated , but no statistical benefits were shown . The benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy that were observed were likely due to a variety of mechanisms , not just a reduction in blood pressure . <EOS>
