<SOS> The role of somatostatin ( octreotide ) in the regulation of melatonin secretion in healthy volunteers and in patients with primary hypothyroidism . Somatostatin has been found in the pineal gland of several animal species , which suggests that it may be involved in the regulation of melatonin secretion . Whether somatostatin has regulatory influence on melatonin secretion in man has never been unequivocally shown . We studied the nocturnal melatonin secretion in 8 healthy volunteers , and 6 women with untreated primary hypothyroidism , a disease state that is associated with increased nocturnal secretion of melatonin . The participants were given subcutaneous injections at 18:00 h and 23:00 h of either saline or octreotide ( Sandostatin ; each injection 50 microg ) . During the nights when the healthy volunteers were given octreotide , melatonin secretion was similar to that recorded during administration of saline . Also the urinary excretion of melatonin was of similar magnitude at these two occasions . By contrast , the GH secretion was significantly lower the nights the healthy controls were given octreotide ( GH AUC 22.6+/-5.4 mU/l x h during octreotide and 126.6+/-21.9 mU/l x h during saline ; p < 0.01 ) . The patients with hypothyroidism also showed similar nocturnal melatonin secretion during octreotide and saline . Urinary excretion of melatonin also remained unchanged , as did GH secretion . The total nocturnal secretion of TSH was , however , significantly reduced by octreotide ( TSH AUC 562+/-136 mU/l x h during octreotide and 851+/-185 mU/l x h during saline ; p < 0.05 ) , thus suggesting that 100 microg of octreotide should be sufficient to inhibit also the pinealocytes if their function were regulated by somatostatin . Since exogenous somatostatin -- in the form of octreotide -- fails to influence nocturnal secretion and urinary excretion of melatonin in normal subjects and in patients with primary hypothyroidism , it is reasonable to assume that endogenous somatostatin may not be an important regulator of melatonin secretion in man . <EOS>
