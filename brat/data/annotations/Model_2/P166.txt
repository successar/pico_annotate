<SOS> Bacteremia due to Bacteroides fragilis after elective appendectomy in renal transplant recipients . Bacteremia caused by Bacteroides fragilis occurred in four of 75 children after renal transplantation , and B. fragilis was the most common cause of postoperative bacteremia . Bacteroides bacteremia was significantly associated with performance of elective appendectomy at the time of transplantation ( P less than 0.01 ) and with profound lymphocytopenia ( P = 0.01 ) . No patient received antibiotics at the time of surgery or prior to the first positive blood culture , yet B. fragilis was the single organism isolated from blood and abscesses in these patients . A role for lymphocytes in containment of B. fragilis has not been suggested previously , although unexplained occurrence of bacteroides bacteremia in immunocompromised patients has occasionally been reported . Lymphocytes themselves may be important in this host-bacterium interaction , or lymphocytopenia may be the marker for a more generalized deficiency in host defenses . <EOS>
