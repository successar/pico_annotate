<SOS> A multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome : the Junior Detective Training Program . BACKGROUND The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new multi-component social skills intervention for children with Asperger syndrome ( AS ) : The Junior Detective Training Program . This 7-week program included a computer game , small group sessions , parent training sessions and teacher handouts . METHOD Forty-nine children with AS were recruited to participate and randomly assigned to intervention ( n = 26 ) or wait-list control ( n = 23 ) conditions . RESULTS Relative to children in the wait-list group , program participants showed greater improvements in social skills over the course of the intervention , as indicated by parent-report measures . Teacher-report data also confirmed that children receiving the intervention made significant improvements in social functioning from pre- to post-treatment . Treatment group participants were better able to suggest appropriate emotion-management strategies for story characters at post-intervention than at pre-intervention , whereas control participants were not . However , there was no difference in the improvements made by children in the intervention and control conditions on facial expression and body-posture recognition measures . Follow-up data suggested that treatment gains were maintained by children at 5-months post-intervention . CONCLUSIONS The Junior Detective Training Program appeared to be effective in enhancing the social skills and emotional understanding of children with AS . Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed . <EOS>
