<SOS> Inhaled fluticasone reduces sputum inflammatory indices in severe bronchiectasis . Although corticosteroid therapy might be clinically beneficial for bronchiectasis , very little is known of its effects on the inflammatory and infective markers in bronchiectasis . We have therefore performed a double-blind , placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of a 4-wk administration of inhaled fluticasone in bronchiectasis . Twenty-four patients ( 12 female ; mean age 51 yr ) were randomized into receiving either inhaled fluticasone ( 500 microgram twice daily ) via the Accuhaler device ( n = 12 ) or placebo . At each visit , spirometry , 24-h sputum volume , sputum leukocyte density , bacterial densities , and concentrations of interleukin ( IL ) -1beta , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) were determined . There was a significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in sputum leukocyte density and IL-1beta , IL-8 , and LTB4 after fluticasone treatment . The fluticasone group had one and the placebo group three episodes of exacerbation . There were no significant changes in spirometry ( p > 0.05 ) or any reported adverse reactions in either group . The results of this study show that high-dose fluticasone is effective in reducing the sputum inflammatory indices in bronchiectasis . Large-scale and long-term studies are indicated to evaluate the effects of inhaled steroid therapy on the inflammatory components in bronchiectasis . <EOS>
