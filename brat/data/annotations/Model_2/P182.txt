<SOS> Analysis of prevention program effectiveness with clustered data using generalized estimating equations . Experimental studies of prevention programs often randomize clusters of individuals rather than individuals to treatment conditions . When the correlation among individuals within clusters is not accounted for in statistical analysis , the standard errors are biased , potentially resulting in misleading conclusions about the significance of treatment effects . This study demonstrates the generalized estimating equations ( GEE ) method , focusing specifically on the GEE-independent method , to control for within-cluster correlation in regression models with either continuous or binary outcomes . The GEE-independent method yields consistent and robust variance estimates . Data from project DARE , a youth substance abuse prevention program , are used for illustration . <EOS>
