<SOS> The efficacy of prophylactic ondansetron , droperidol , perphenazine , and metoclopramide in the prevention of nausea and vomiting after major gynecologic surgery . The prophylactic antiemetic efficacy of intravenous ( i.v . ) ondansetron , droperidol , perphenazine , and metoclopramide was evaluated in a prospective , double-blind study of 360 ASA physical status I-III patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy ( TAH ) . Subjects were randomized to receive i.v. , one of ondansetron 4 mg , droperidol 1.25 mg , perphenazine 5 mg , metoclopramide 10 mg , or placebo prior to induction of anesthesia . Hypotension immediately after administration of metoclopramide was observed in two patients and four patients given ondansetron developed profound systolic hypotension at induction of anesthesia . Twenty-two percent of patients receiving droperidol became sedated . Postoperatively , patients developing severe nausea , retching , or vomiting , defined as severe emetic sequelae ( SES ) , were deemed to have failed antiemetic prophylaxis and received antiemetic rescue . A significantly larger number of patients who received i.v . ondansetron ( 63 % ) , droperidol ( 76 % ) , and perphenazine ( 70 % ) were free of SES when compared to placebo ( 43 % ) ; P < 0.05 . Metoclopramide was ineffective . Although ondansetron , droperidol , and perphenazine were effective in providing antiemetic prophylaxis , only i.v . perphenazine was free of side effects . Hence , we conclude that perphenazine is the best choice for antiemetic prophylaxis after TAH . <EOS>
