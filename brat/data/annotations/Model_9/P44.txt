<SOS> [ Effect of branch chain amino acid enriched formula on postoperative fatigue and nutritional status after digestive surgery ] . OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of branch chain amino acid ( BCAA ) enriched formula on nutritional status and postoperative fatigue for digestive surgery patients . METHODS Forty patients who underwent digestive surgery were randomly received parenteral nutrition with either BCAA enriched ( study group , n=20 ) or routine amino acid ( control group , n=20 ) for seven consecutive days . Nitrogen balance , serum total protein , albumin , prealbumin , transferrin , retinol binding protein and postoperative fatigue score were monitored during the postoperative period . RESULTS The cumulative postoperative fatigue scores were lower in BCAA group than that in the control group at the 4th , 5th and 7th day after operation ( P < 0.05 ) . Patients achieved positive nitrogen balance 2 days earlier in the study group than that in the control group , but there was no significant difference in cumulative nitrogen balance between the two groups . There was no significant difference in elevation of serum total protein , albumin , prealbumin , transferrin at the 7th day after operation between the two groups ( P > 0.05 ) , compared with those at the first day after operation . The serum level of retinol binding protein was higher in BCAA-enriched group than that in the control group ( P=0.004 ) . CONCLUSION TPN with BCAA enriched formula can reduce postoperative fatigue score and improve the nutritional status for digestive surgery patients . <EOS>
