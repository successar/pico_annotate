<SOS> [ Effect of liu wei di huang or jin gui shen qi decoction as on adjuvant treatment in small cell lung cancer ] . Eighty-three patients with small cell lung cancer were randomized with or without using a traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction ( Liu Wei Di Huang or Jin Gui Shen Qi medicinal decoction ) in chemotherapy or radiotherapy courses . 74 patients were availble to be analysis . The two treatment groups were well-matched in age , sex , stage and performance status . There was a statistically significant difference in response rate and the median survival between two groups . The overall response rate ( CR+PR ) was 91.5 % for Chinese herb group and 46.9 % for control group ( P less than 0.001 ) . The median survival was 16 months for the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction group , and 10 months for the control group ( P less than 0.05 ) . Survival curve ( Kaplan-meire 's ) of the Chinese herb group was better than that of the control group . 10 patients of Chinese herb group was alive beyond more than 2 years . Until now , 4 patients in the Chinese herb group , one in the control group are still enjoying their disease-free life for more than 7 years . Hematologic toxicities were observed much frequently in the patients of the control group ( P less than 0.005 and 0.01/WBC and BPC ) . Results of animal experiments with the same traditional medicinal decoctions as used in clinic have showed immuno-enhancement activities . These results have showed that the traditional Chinese Kidney-tonifying decoction may enhance non-specific immunology activities and may be much useful for solid cancer patients as an adjuvant treatment . <EOS>
