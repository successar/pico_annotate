<SOS> Teaching emotion recognition skills to young children with autism : a randomised controlled trial of an emotion training programme . BACKGROUND Children with autism have difficulties in emotion recognition and a number of interventions have been designed to target these problems . However , few emotion training interventions have been trialled with young children with autism and co-morbid ID . This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an emotion training programme for a group of young children with autism with a range of intellectual ability . METHODS Participants were 55 children with autistic disorder , aged 4-7 years ( FSIQ 42-107 ) . Children were randomly assigned to an intervention ( n = 28 ) or control group ( n = 27 ) . Participants in the intervention group watched a DVD designed to teach emotion recognition skills to children with autism ( the Transporters ) , whereas the control group watched a DVD of Thomas the Tank Engine . Participants were assessed on their ability to complete basic emotion recognition tasks , mindreading and theory of mind ( TOM ) tasks before and after the 4-week intervention period , and at 3-month follow-up . RESULTS Analyses controlled for the effect of chronological age , verbal intelligence , gender and DVD viewing time on outcomes . Children in the intervention group showed improved performance in the recognition of anger compared with the control group , with few improvements maintained at 3-month follow-up . There was no generalisation of skills to TOM or social skills . CONCLUSIONS The Transporters programme showed limited efficacy in teaching basic emotion recognition skills to young children with autism with a lower range of cognitive ability . Improvements were limited to the recognition of expressions of anger , with poor maintenance of these skills at follow-up . These findings provide limited support for the efficacy of the Transporters programme for young children with autism of a lower cognitive range . <EOS>
