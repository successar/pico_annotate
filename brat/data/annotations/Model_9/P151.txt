<SOS> Low doses of ketazolam in anxiety : a double-blind , placebo-controlled study . A multicenter , double-blind , between-patient trial comparing two doses of ketazolam ( 15 and 30 mg ) with placebo , each given once daily , in the evening , to 92 outpatients affected by generalized anxiety disorders for at least 1 month , was carried out . After 1-week washout period 47 patients were randomized to ketazolam 15 mg , and 45 to placebo for 15 days ( first period ) . At the end of this period , if the patient experienced a decrease on the total Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) of at least 25 % of basal value , the treatment was kept unchanged for a further 15 days , otherwise 15 mg of ketazolam were added to the previous treatment ( second period ) . Anxiety was rated after 2 and 4 weeks with the Italian HAM-A scale and with a 4-point scale ( patient 's assessment ) . Seventy-eight patients completed the first period and 75 the whole study . During the first period the percentage of responders was almost identical in both treatment groups , but during the second period a further slight improvement was observed in the early placebo responders , while the HAM-A score of patients on ketazolam continued to improve significantly ( p less than 0.01 ) throughout the study . Likewise a significant ( p less than 0.001 ) difference between treatments was observed , on the 4-point scale , in the population as a whole ( end of first period ) as well as in responder patients ( end second period ) . Tolerability was good , except in 1 patient on placebo , who was withdrawn from the study because of severe headache . <EOS>
