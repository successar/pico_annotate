<SOS> Combined descriptive and explanatory information improves peers ' perceptions of autism . Authors examined the combined effects of descriptive and explanatory information on peers ' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward an unfamiliar child with autism . Children ( N = 576 ; M age = 10.06 ) were randomly assigned to view two videotapes of a boy engaging in typical and autistic behaviors receiving either descriptive ( AUT-D ) or descriptive and explanatory information ( AUT-D + E ) . Children responded to measures of attitudes ( Adjective Checklist ) and behavioral intentions ( Shared Activities Questionnaire ) . Children rated the typical boy more favorably than the boy showing autistic symptoms . When compared to descriptive information alone , the combination of descriptive and explanatory information resulted in improved third- and fourth-graders ' but not fifth-graders ' attitudes toward the child with autism . Combined information improved behavioral intentions across grades ; however , girls ( vs. boys ) were more responsive to information as evidenced by differences in academic intentions . The combination of descriptive and explanatory information about autism appears to have a positive effect on children 's attitudes and behavioral intentions . Implications of the findings are briefly discussed as well as study limitations and recommendations for future research . <EOS>
