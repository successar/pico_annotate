<SOS> Ascaris and growth rates : a randomized trial of treatment . Three hundred forty-one Tanzanian preschool children were randomly assigned to levamisole or placebo treatment given at three-month intervals . Weights and heights were measured at the tri-monthly treatment visits for a period of one year . Among the 273 children who were seen and weighed at the one-year follow-up visit , the rate of weight gain was 8 per cent greater for those receiving levamisole than for placebo-treated controls ( p = .06 ) . In 78 children known to be infected with Ascaris at baseline , the rate of weight gain was 21 per cent greater in children treated with levamisole than in those receiving placebo ( p = .03 ) . The rate of height gain was no different for treatment and placebo groups . <EOS>
