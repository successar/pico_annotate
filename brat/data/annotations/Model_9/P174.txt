<SOS> Necessary but not sufficient : the effect of screening and feedback on outcomes of primary care patients with untreated anxiety . OBJECTIVE To consider the impact on primary care patient outcomes of using both a screener to determine elevated anxiety levels among patients with previously undetected anxiety and a physician intervention to inform physicians of their patients ' conditions . DESIGN Participating physicians were randomized to either the demonstration or the control arm , and patients were assigned to a study arm based on the randomization of their physicians . The patients were followed for change in outcome measures during the five-month study period . SETTING A mixed-model health maintenance organization serving approximately 110,000 enrollees in central Colorado . PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS 573 patients who had unrecognized and untreated anxiety identified from the approximately 8,000 patients who completed the waiting room screening questionnaire . INTERVENTIONS A physician intervention served the dual function of 1 ) providing an educational demonstration of anxiety in the primary care setting and 2 ) providing a reporting system for summarizing the anxiety symptom levels and functioning status of the patients enrolled in the study . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient outcomes were measured as changes in global anxiety scores , functioning and well-being , and patients ' reports of global improvements . CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that this method of reporting symptoms and functioning status to primary care physicians did not significantly change patient outcomes . Improvement in outcomes appeared to be more closely associated with the patient 's severity of psychological distress . <EOS>
