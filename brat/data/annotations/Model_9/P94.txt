<SOS> [ Clinical study on treatment of endometriosis-related infertility patients by laparoscopic surgery in combination of quyu jiedu recipe ] . OBJECTIVE To study the clinical efficacy of the laparoscopic surgery in combination of Quyu Jiedu Recipe ( QYJDR ) on endometriosis ( EMs ) -related infertility patients . METHODS 130 EMs-related infertility patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome diagnosed and treated by laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to two groups , i.e. , the test group ( 75 cases ) and the control group ( 55 cases ) . All patients received routine progesterone treatment after laparoscopic surgery . QYJDR was given to patients in the test group after laparoscopic surgery , lasting for twelve months . The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery were compared between the two groups . The Chinese medicine syndrome integrals , serum endometrium antibody ( EMAb ) and cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) levels were compared between before drug therapy and three months after drug therapy . RESULTS The pregnancy rate within one year after laparoscopic surgery was higher in the test group than in the control group [ 61.33 % ( 46/75 ) vs 45.45 % ( 25/55 ) ] , showing significant difference ( P < 0.05 ) . The Chinese medicine syndrome integral was ( 16.07 +/- 6.77 ) score and ( 7.25 +/- 3.27 ) score before and 3 months after drug therapy in the test group , while it was ( 15.92 +/- 7.51 ) score and ( 12.73 +/- 6.12 ) score in the control group . The Chinese medicine syndrome integral after drug therapy was lower than that before drug therapy in the same group . Besides , the integral difference between before and after drug therapy was higher in the test group than in the control group [ ( 9.12 +/- 6.16 ) score vs ( 3.48 +/- 2.06 ) score ) ] , showing statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) . After three-month drug therapy , the serum EMAb negative conversion rate was obviously higher in the test group than in the control group ( 44.44 % vs 15.62 % ) , showing statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) . The serum CA125 level was ( 31.88 +/- 15.78 ) U/mL before drug therapy and ( 18.82 +/- 10.08 ) U/mL three months after drug therapy in the test group , while it was ( 30.63 +/- 19.28 ) U/mL and ( 18.05 +/- 11.20 ) U/mL respectively in the control group . It was lowered after drug therapy in the two groups with statistical difference ( P < 0.05 ) . There was no statistical difference between the two groups after drug therapy ( P > 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS The laparoscopic surgery in combination of QYJDR could effectively improve clinical symptoms of EMs patients of blood stasis and toxin accumulation syndrome , promote negative conversion of EMAb , lower serum CA125 levels , and elevate the clinical pregnancy rate . QYJDR is an effective formula in treatment of EMs-related infertility . <EOS>
