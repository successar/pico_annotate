<SOS> Time-varying smoking abstinence predicts lower depressive symptoms following smoking cessation treatment . INTRODUCTION The question of whether abstinence during the months following a planned quit attempt exacerbates or improves depressive symptoms is an important clinical issue . Extant research has primarily modeled between-person covariation between postquit abstinence and depressive symptom trajectories . However , this approach can not account for potential third variables between participants that may affect both smoking and depression . Accordingly , the current study examined within-person covariation between time-varying abstinence and depressive symptom in a multilevel model ( MLM ) , which allowed for transitions between smoking statuses within a participant . METHODS Participants were 236 heavy drinking smokers in a randomized clinical trial testing the efficacy of incorporating brief alcohol intervention into smoking cessation treatment . Depressive symptoms and biochemically verified abstinence were assessed 1 week prior to and 2 , 8 , 16 , and 26 weeks after quit date . RESULTS MLMs indicated a slight increase in depressive symptoms over time in the sample as a whole . However , there was an inverse relation between time-varying abstinence ( vs. smoking ) and concurrent level of depressive symptoms , indicating that transitions from smoking to abstinence within individuals were associated with reductions in depressive symptoms . CONCLUSIONS During the first 6 months following a planned quit attempt , being abstinent in a particular week appears to be associated with lower levels of concurrent depressive symptoms . These results are not concordant with the view that intentional smoking abstinence exacerbates depressive symptoms . Efforts to promote smoking cessation should highlight that individuals are likely to feel more rather than less psychologically healthy when they successfully quit smoking . <EOS>
