<SOS> Youth with autism spectrum disorder comprehend lexicalized and novel primary conceptual metaphors . Individuals with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) have difficulty comprehending metaphors . However , no study to date has examined whether or not they understand conceptual metaphors ( i.e . mappings between conceptual structures ) , which could be the building blocks of metaphoric thinking and understanding . We investigated whether 13 participants with ASD ( age 7 ; 03-22 ; 03 ) and 13 age-matched typically developing ( TD ) controls could comprehend lexicalized conceptual metaphors ( e.g. , Susan is a warm person ) and novel ones ( e.g. , Susan is a toasty person ) . Individuals with ASD performed at greater than chance levels on both metaphor types , although their performance was lower than TD participants . We discuss the theoretical relevance of these findings and educational implications . <EOS>
