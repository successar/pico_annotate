<SOS> To compare the efficacy and safety of nifedipine sustained release with Ginkgo biloba extract to treat patients with primary Raynaud 's phenomenon in South Korea ; Korean Raynaud study ( KOARA study ) . This study examined the efficacy and safety of nifedipine sustained release ( nifedipine SR ) compared with Ginkgo biloba extract as treatment for primary Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) in Korea . Primary RP were screened and assigned to either the nifedipine SR group ( Group N ) or the Ginkgo biloba extract group ( Group G ) in the ratio of 2:1 . After a run-in period of 2 weeks , patients received treatment for 8 weeks . We observed the percent improvement of the RP attack rate between before and after the 8-week treatment . Ninety-three subjects were randomly assigned . The percent improvement in Group N was 50.1 % at 8 weeks after treatment , while it was 31.0 % in Group G ( p = 0.03 ) . No serious adverse events occurred , and almost adverse events were mild and improved without specific treatment . nifedipine SR was more effective than Ginkgo biloba extract for treatment of primary RP in Korean patients . Both drugs were tolerable with primary RP patients . <EOS>
