<SOS> Salbutamol or mist in acute bronchiolitis . BACKGROUND The role of bronchodilators in the treatment of bronchiolitis remains controversial . METHODS A double-blind , placebo controlled trial was performed to evaluate the clinical response to nebulized salbutamol . One hundred and fifty-six infants aged between 7 weeks and 24 months who had had an episode of wheezing and other signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis were randomized to three groups as follows : ( i ) nebulized salbutamol was administered to 52 patients in group I at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg in 2 mL saline ; ( ii ) saline was nebulized to 52 patients in group II and ( iii ) in group III 52 patients received mist in a tent . All three groups were administered oxygen during the procedures . Treatment was repeated with the same agent after 30 min if the respiratory score was 5 or more . Respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation and presence of cyanosis , wheezing , retractions were recorded before and after each treatment . RESULTS The decrease in the respiratory score was 5.2 +/- 1.8 , 0.82 +/- 2.4 and 1.7 +/- 1.3 in group I , II and III , respectively . The decrease in group I was significantly higher than in the other groups . Heart rate was similar between groups . Oxygen saturation decreased in group I without reaching statistical significance . CONCLUSIONS Salbutamol was shown to be effective and safe in the treatment of acute bronchiolitis . <EOS>
