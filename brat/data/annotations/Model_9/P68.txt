<SOS> A comparison of continuous femoral nerve block ( CFNB ) and continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) in postoperative analgesia and knee rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . BACKGROUND Postoperative epidural analgesia ( EA ) and femoral nerve block ( FNB ) provided effective pain relief However , EA has common side effects such as nausea , vomiting , pruritus , dizziness , and hypotension . Some investigations found that those side effects were less in FNB than in EA . However the analgesic equivalent of both techniques have not been confirmed . OBJECTIVE The authors compared continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) with continuous femoral nerve block ( CFNB ) regarding the postoperative analgesic efficacy , side effects , postoperative knee rehabilitation , and hospital length of stay ( LOS ) . MATERIAL AND METHOD In this prospective , randomized controlled study , 61 ASA physical status I-III patients scheduled for elective unilateral total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) under spinal anesthesia ( SA ) participated . The patients were allocated into two groups . In the ward , patients in Group I ( CEI ) were maintained by continuous infusion of 0.125 % levobupivacaine with morphine 0.0125 mg/ml ( 4 ml/hr ) , Group II ( CFNB ) were maintained by 0.125 % levobupivacaine ( 8 ml/hr ) . RESULTS Patients in the CFNB group , the VAS scores at PO6-12 hr and tramadol IV requirement were significantly greater than the CEI group ( VAS : PO6 hr p-value = 0.001 , PO12 hr p-value = 0.004 ) . Patients in the CEI group experienced dizziness , pruritus , and PONV more than the CFNB group significantly . Patient satisfaction was greater with the CFNB group although postoperative knee rehabilitation and the hospital LOS were not different . CONCLUSION CFNB represents the optimal analgesia with fewer side effects and greater patient , satisfaction . The rehabilitation indices and duration of hospital stay are comparable in both groups . <EOS>
