<SOS> Additive IOP-reducing effect of latanoprost in patients insufficiently controlled on timolol . PURPOSE To evaluate the effect on intraocular pressure ( IOP ) of switching from timolol to latanoprost or adding latanoprost to timolol in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension where IOP is not adequately controlled with timolol . METHODS This was a 6-week , double-masked , randomised multi-centre study . 53 patients with primary open angle glaucoma , capsular glaucoma , or ocular hypertension with an IOP of at least 21 mmHg on current therapy were recruited . After a run-in period of at least 2 weeks on timolol , 5 mg/ml twice daily , patients were randomised to one of three groups . One group continued on timolol , one switched from timolol to latanoprost , 50 microg/ml once daily , and a third group received latanoprost in addition to timolol . The efficacy was evaluated by comparing IOP at 9 AM at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment . RESULTS IOP at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment ( mean +/- SEM ) were 24.2 +/- 0.9 and 23.8 +/- 1.0 mmHg ( n = 16 ) for patients continuing on timolol , 26.3 +/- 1.2 and 19.6 +/- 1.1 mmHg ( n = 17 ) for patients switching to latanoprost , and 23.2 +/- 1.0 and 17.5 +/- 0.8 mmHg ( n = 17 ) for patients with combined treatment . Adding latanoprost to timolol reduced IOP with 5.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) and switching from timolol to latanoprost reduced IOP with 5.0 +/- 0.9 mmHg ( p < 0.001 ) , which caused in each group a significant IOP reduction of about 25 % . CONCLUSIONS The effect of latanoprost was additive to that of timolol , and a good effect on IOP reduction was also achieved by switching from timolol to latanoprost , suggesting that a switch in many patients is an effective alternative to combination treatment . <EOS>
