<SOS> Prediction of creatinine clearance from serum creatinine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis : comparison of six formulae and one nomogram . The estimation of glomerular filtration rate is important for the medical treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . However , the determination of endogenous creatinine clearance ( Clcr ) from a 24-h urine collection is an unreliable and time-consuming procedure . We therefore tested the accuracy of six equations and one nomogram for the prediction of Clcr from serum creatinine ( Scr ) in 38 patients with RA and 20 controls . A positive correlation was found for all methods in the controls ( r = 0.83-0.94 ) and RA patients ( r = 0.51-0.69 ) . The methods did not overestimate Clcr in RA . In the RA group the simple formula published by Cockcroft [ Clcr = ( ( 140 - age ) x body weight ) / ( 72 x Scr ) , x 0.85 for females ] showed the best correlation with the measured Clcr . In RA the Cockroft formula can reliably be used to predict Clcr from Scr . <EOS>
