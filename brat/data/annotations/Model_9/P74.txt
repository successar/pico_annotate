<SOS> The effect of weight training on bone mineral density and bone turnover in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors with bone loss : a 24-month randomized controlled trial . SUMMARY This study examined whether 24 months of weight training exercises enhanced the effectiveness of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D in maintaining or improving bone mineral density ( BMD ) in 223 postmenopausal breast cancer survivors . Subjects who were > or =50 % adherent to exercise had no improvement in BMD but were less likely to lose BMD . INTRODUCTION This study examined whether ( 1 ) postmenopausal breast cancer survivors ( BCS ) with bone loss taking 24 months of risedronate , calcium , and vitamin D had increased bone mineral density ( BMD ) at the total hip , femoral neck , L1-L4 spine , total radius and 33 % radius , and decreased bone turnover ; ( 2 ) subjects who also participated in strength/weight training ( ST ) exercises had greater increases in BMD and greater decreases in bone turnover ; and ( 3 ) subjects who also exercised were more likely to preserve ( at least maintain ) BMD . METHODS Postmenopausal BCS ( 223 ) were randomly assigned to exercise plus medication or medication only groups . Both groups received 24 months of 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D daily and 35 mg of risedronate weekly , and the exercise group additionally had ST exercises twice weekly . RESULTS After 24 months , women who took medications without exercising had significant improvements in BMD at the total hip ( +1.81 % ) and spine ( +2.85 % ) and significant decreases in Alkphase B ( -8.7 % ) and serum NTx ( -16.7 % ) . Women who also exercised had additional increases in BMD at the femoral neck ( +0.29 % ) , total hip ( +0.34 % ) , spine ( +0.23 % ) , total radius ( +0.30 % ) , and additional decreases in Alkphase B ( -2.4 % ) and Serum NTx ( -6.5 % ) . Additional changes in BMD and bone turnover with exercise were not significant . Subjects who were > or =50 % adherent to exercise were less likely to lose BMD at the total hip ( chi-square [ 1 ] = 4.66 , p = 0.03 ) and femoral neck ( chi-square [ 1 ] = 4.63 , p = 0.03 ) . CONCLUSION Strength/weight training exercises may prevent loss of BMD in postmenopausal BCS at risk for bone loss . <EOS>
