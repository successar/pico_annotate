<SOS> Is a 2-week duration sufficient for stenting in endopyelotomy ? PURPOSE Internal stenting is an integral part of endopyelotomy . Studies in animals show good healing after 1 to 2 weeks of ureterotomy . Inherent stent related problems warrant a minimum possible duration of stenting without compromising the results of endopyelotomy . We performed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the optimum duration of stenting after endopyelotomy . MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 57 consecutive patients with primary ureteropelvic junction obstruction were randomized to undergo 7/14Fr internal endopyelotomy stent placement for 2 ( group 1 ) and 4 ( group 2 ) weeks . A symptom based questionnaire was administered to all patients at stent removal . Followup was done with diuretic scanning at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months and then yearly , and thereafter with diuretic renography . RESULTS In each group 26 patients were available for evaluation . The 2 groups were comparable in terms of age , sex , symptoms and ipsilateral glomerular filtration rate . Mean followup was 22.3 ( range 12 to 36 ) and 21.3 months ( range 12 to 35 ) in groups 1 and 2 , respectively . At the end of 1 year 24 group 1 ( 92.3 % ) and 23 group 2 ( 90.3 % ) patients had an improved drainage pattern . This difference was not significant . Stent related symptoms were present in a good proportion of patients in groups 1 and 2 but there was a significant difference in the incidence of urinary tract infections ( 11.5 % versus 38.1 % , p = 0.04 ) . Of the group 2 patients 64 % preferred 2 weeks of stenting . CONCLUSIONS Two weeks seems to be a sufficient duration to allow functional restoration across the ureteropelvic junction after endopyelotomy and decrease stent related complications . <EOS>
