<SOS> Levobunolol compared with timolol : a four-year study . Fifty-one patients with raised intraocular pressure ( IOP ) were treated for up to four years with one of three ophthalmic solutions : 0.5 % levobunolol , 1 % levobunolol , or 0.5 % timolol . The study was conducted as a double-masked , randomised trial in which medications were administered twice daily to both eyes . Levobunolol and timolol were equally effective in reducing overall mean IOP ; reductions were greater than 8.8 mmHg in all three treatment groups . The study showed levobunolol to be as safe and effective as timolol in the long-term control of raised IOP . <EOS>
