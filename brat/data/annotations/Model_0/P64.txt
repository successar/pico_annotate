<SOS> Bolus injection of contrast agents with various iodine concentrations and delivery rates for intracranial three-dimensional CT angiography : evaluation of intracranial arteriovenous contrast using a multidetector-row CT scanner . PURPOSE We evaluated the difference in computed tomography ( CT ) attenuation values of the intracranial arterial and venous systems among the various contrast injection protocols ( higher iodine delivery rate or higher concentration of the agent ) on the source images of intracranial three-dimensional CT angiography ( 3D-CTA ) using a multidetector-row CT ( MDCT ) scanner . MATERIALS AND METHODS We used 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml/s , 100 ml of iopamidol 300 at an injection rate of 3.7 ml/s , and 80 ml of iopamidol 370 at an injection rate of 3.0 ml/s . There were 10 patients in each group . Attenuation values of the bilateral internal carotid arteries ( ICAs ) , basilar artery trunk , bilateral cavernous sinuses ( CSs ) , and Galenic vein were measured quantitatively on the axial CT angiographic source images obtained by four-channel MDCT . RESULTS Injection of the high-concentration contrast with a higher iodine-delivery rate achieved good arteriovenous contrast at the cavernous portion . With the same rate of iodine delivery , injection of the intermediate concentrate agent increased the CT value of not only the ICAs but also the CSs . CONCLUSION High-concentration contrast could increase ICA attenuation without intracavernous attenuation gain during the first-pass phase . <EOS>
