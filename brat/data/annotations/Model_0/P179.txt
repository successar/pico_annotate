<SOS> Effects of tryptophan depletion in drug-free adults with autistic disorder . BACKGROUND The primary objective of this study was to investigate the behavioral and biochemical responses to acute tryptophan depletion in drug-free adult patients with autistic disorder . METHODS Twenty drug-free adults with autistic disorder ( 16 men and 4 women ) ( mean [ +/- SD ] age , 30.5 +/- 8.5 years ) underwent short-term tryptophan depletion in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized crossover design . Patients received a 24-hour , low-tryptophan diet followed the next morning by an amino acid drink . Behavioral ratings were obtained on the morning of the amino acid drink ( baseline ) and 180 , 300 , and 420 minutes after the drink . Plasma free and total tryptophan levels were obtained at baseline and 5 hours after the drink . The active and sham testing sessions were separated by 7 days . RESULTS Eleven ( 65 % ) of the 17 patients who completed both test days showed a significant global worsening of behavioral symptoms with short-term tryptophan depletion , but none of the 17 patients showed any significant change in clinical status from baseline after sham depletion ( P = .001 ) . Tryptophan depletion led to a significant increase in behaviors such as whirling , flapping , pacing , banging and hitting self , rocking , and toe walking ( P < .05 ) . In addition , patients were significantly less calm and happy and more anxious . No significant change was observed in social relatedness or repetitive thoughts and behavior . Plasma total and free tryptophan levels were reduced 86 % and 69 % , respectively , 5 hours after the tryptophan-deficient amino acid drink . Patients who had a significant global exacerbation of symptoms had significantly higher baseline plasma total tryptophan levels ( P < .001 ) and Autism Behavior Checklist scores ( P = .005 ) than did patients who showed no significant change in symptoms after tryptophan depletion . CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are consistent with previous research that has implicated a dysregulation in serotonin function in some patients with autism . These data suggest that the short-term reduction of serotonin precursor availability may exacerbate some symptoms characteristic of autism in some patients . Continued investigation into the role of serotonin in the pathogenesis and treatment of autistic disorder is warranted . <EOS>
