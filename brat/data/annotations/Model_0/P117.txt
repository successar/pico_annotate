<SOS> Role of posterior tibial nerve stimulation in the treatment of refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis : a pilot study . PURPOSE We evaluated the early clinical and urodynamic results of posterior tibial nerve stimulation in patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis . MATERIALS AND METHODS We randomly assigned 28 patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis to 2 equal groups . Group 1 received a weekly session of posterior tibial nerve stimulation for 12 weeks and group 2 was the placebo group . Evaluation was performed in each group at baseline and after posterior tibial nerve stimulation to compare clinical and urodynamic findings . Another clinical assessment was done 3 months after the first followup . RESULTS The 2 groups were comparable in baseline clinical and urodynamic data . Overall , 13 patients ( 46.4 % ) had detrusor overactivity and 14 ( 50 % ) had decreased bladder capacity . After treatment 11 group 1 patients ( 78.6 % ) had a partial or full response to posterior tibial nerve stimulation but only 2 ( 14.3 % ) in group 2 had a partial response ( p = 0.002 ) . Also , the average number of wet nights in group 1 was significantly lower than at baseline ( p = 0.002 ) . All urodynamic parameters significantly improved in group 1 . In contrast , the number of wet nights and urodynamic parameters did not change significantly in group 2 . At 3-month followup the number of patients with a partial or full response in group 1 had decreased from 11 ( 78.6 % ) to 6 ( 42.9 % ) . No change was evident in group 2 . CONCLUSIONS Posterior tibial nerve stimulation can be a viable treatment option in some patients with refractory monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis . However , deterioration in some responders with time suggests the need for maintenance protocols . <EOS>
