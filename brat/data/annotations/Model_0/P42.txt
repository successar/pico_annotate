<SOS> Effects of Saccharomyces boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea . AIM Certain probiotic agents , e.g . Lactobacillus GG , have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhoea , but few studies have examined the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii . We evaluated the effect of S. boulardii in children with acute diarrhoea . METHODS Two hundred children were randomized to receive S. boulardii in a granulated form in a daily dose of 250 mg ( S. boulardii group ) or placebo ( placebo group ) for 5 d. Clinical and demographic characteristics on admission were similar between the study groups . RESULTS The medians of the average stool frequency after the second day of the treatment were significantly lower in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group ( p = 0.003 ) . The duration of diarrhoea significantly reduced in the S. boulardii group compared with the placebo group ( 4.7 vs 5.5 d , p = 0.03 ) . The effect of S. boulardii on watery diarrhoea became apparent after the second day of the treatment . The duration of hospital stay was shorter in the S. boulardii group than in the placebo group ( 2.9 vs 3.9 d , p < 0.001 ) . Four children from the placebo group versus only one child from the S. boulardii group had persisting diarrhoea . CONCLUSION The placebo-controlled study suggested that S. boulardii significantly reduced the duration of acute diarrhoea and the duration of hospital stay . S. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically . <EOS>
