<SOS> Effect of treatment with paromomycin on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease -- a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . The results of experimental and clinical studies support the hypothesis that gut-derived endotoxins might be of relevance for the development and course of alcoholic liver disease . The aim of this study was to test the effect of a nonabsorbable , broad-spectrum antibiotic on endotoxemia in patients with alcoholic liver disease . Fifty patients with alcoholic liver disease ( 27 with cirrhosis , 23 without cirrhosis ) were randomly assigned to receive either paromomycin sulfate ( 3 x 1 g/day ) or placebo in a double-blind fashion for at least 3 weeks , and if possible 4 weeks . Endotoxin concentration , liver function tests , and other laboratory parameters were determined in weekly intervals . Endotoxin concentration was also determined in 15 healthy controls . Groups receiving paromomycin or placebo were similar for clinical and biological items collected initially . Mean initial endotoxin concentrations were significantly elevated in both groups ( mean +/- SEM ; paromomycin , 16.7 +/- 5.3 pg/ml ; placebo , 17.5 +/- 6.9 pg/ml ; healthy controls , 2.3 +/- 0.4 pg/ml ) . Although the mean endotoxin concentration was lower in the verum group after 1 week ( paromomycin , 8.0 +/- 1.9 pg/ml ; placebo , 14.6 +/- 3.5 pg/ml ; p > 0.05 ) , paromomycin treatment had no significant effect on endotoxin concentration or liver function tests during the 4-week period . The beneficial effect of paromomycin treatment on endotoxemia in cirrhotics reported in earlier studies could not be reproduced under the conditions of this trial in patients with alcoholic liver disease . <EOS>
