<SOS> Effects of soy intake on sex hormone metabolism in premenopausal women . Studies suggest that phytoestrogens in soy products may impart hormonal effects that protect women against breast cancer . Limited research suggests that intake of soy products high in isoflavonoid phytoestrogens affects sex hormone metabolism , but it is unknown whether phytoestrogens in soy have any effect on menstrual function or serum sex hormones in women on common hormone therapies , such as oral contraceptives ( OC ) . We studied the effects of soy in 36 premenopausal women , 20 of whom used OC . Subjects consumed their normal diet for two menstrual cycles and added a soy beverage containing 20 g of protein and 38 mg of total isoflavones to their usual diet for another two menstrual cycles . No significant differences were observed in serum estrone , estradiol , sex hormone-binding globulin , dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate , prolactin , or progesterone concentrations with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group . No changes in menstrual cycle length or the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone were seen with soy feeding in the non-OC or the OC group . Levels of urinary estrogen metabolites were significantly different between the non-OC and the OC group . Thus soy consumption had no significant effect on the menstrual cycle , serum sex hormones , or urinary estrogen metabolite ratio in premenopausal OC or non-OC users . <EOS>
