<SOS> Teacher and child predictors of achieving IEP goals of children with autism . It is encouraging that children with autism show a strong response to early intervention , yet more research is needed for understanding the variability in responsiveness to specialized programs . Treatment predictor variables from 47 teachers and children who were randomized to receive the COMPASS intervention ( Ruble et al . in The collaborative model for promoting competence and success for students with ASD . Springer , New York , 2012a ) were analyzed . Predictors evaluated against child IEP goal attainment included child , teacher , intervention practice , and implementation practice variables based on an implementation science framework ( Dunst and Trivette in J Soc Sci 8:143-148 , 2012 ) . Findings revealed one child ( engagement ) , one teacher ( exhaustion ) , two intervention quality ( IEP quality for targeted and not targeted elements ) , and no implementation quality variables accounted for variance in child outcomes when analyzed separately . When the four significant variables were compared against each other in a single regression analysis , IEP quality accounted for one quarter of the variance in child outcomes . <EOS>
