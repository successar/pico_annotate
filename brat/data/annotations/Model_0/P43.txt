<SOS> Interventions in the initial prodromal states of psychosis in Germany : concept and recruitment . BACKGROUND The Early Detection and Intervention Programme of the German Research Network on Schizophrenia ( GRNS ) investigates the initial prodromal phase of psychosis in a multidimensional approach . Two intervention strategies are being studied by two large-scale multicentre projects . AIMS To present the concept of the intervention studies , and to provide an interim report of the recruitment procedure . METHOD Comprehensive cognitive-behavioural therapy has been developed for patients in the early initial prodromal state . For patients in the late initial prodromal state the atypical neuroleptic amisulpride is explored . Both interventions are evaluated in randomised controlled trials using clinical management as the control condition . RESULTS Between January 2001 and March 2003 , 1212 individuals seeking help for mental health problems were screened for putative prodromal symptoms at four university centres . More than 388 individuals fulfilled criteria for both interventions and 188 ( 48.5 % ) gave informed consent to participate in the trials . CONCLUSIONS The screening procedure appears to be feasible and trial participation seems to be acceptable to a relevant proportion of people at increased risk of developing psychosis . <EOS>
