<SOS> [ The chemotherapy of advanced breast cancer . A report on the first 600 cases in a cooperative programme to carry out a systematic study ( 1974-1977 ) ( author 's transl ) ] . The authors explain the objectives and the structure of a programme evolved for the methodic study of advanced breast cancers which they have worked out and carried out in cooperation with the departments of medicine in eight French anticancer centres . They analyse the initial phases , which correspond to the three first years of work . They give the state of the results that have been obtained in 603 patients using three protocols for treatment . These consisted of the administration in interrupted doses of chemotherapy which consisted of vincristine associated for the one part with cyclophosphamide and 5-fluoro-uracil and on the other hand with doxorubicine or/and with methotrexate . From this study there emerged the value of combined therapy using doxorubicine as much because of the frequency with which results better than 50 % were obtained ( in a randomised trial ) as by their quality , which was made clear in an important series of 240 cases . They point out the conditions required to initiate the place of such a scheme in all complex therapy which aims as much at palliation as at cure , and point out how important it is to be methodical in the application of chemotherapy in order to ensure its development as an anticancer therapy . <EOS>
