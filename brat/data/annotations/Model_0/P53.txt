<SOS> Salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate versus fluticasone propionate plus montelukast : a randomised controlled trial investigating the effects on airway inflammation in asthma . BACKGROUND Few studies have compared treatment strategies in patients with asthma poorly controlled on low dose inhaled corticosteroids , and little is known about the effects of different treatments on airway inflammation . In this double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study , we compared the effects of salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate ( FP ) ( Seretide ; SFC ) and FP plus montelukast ( FP/M ) on sputum inflammatory markers , airway responsiveness , lung function , and symptoms in adult asthmatics . METHODS Sixty-six subjects were randomised to SFC or FP/M for 12 weeks . The primary outcome was changes in neutrophil , eosinophil , macrophage , lymphocyte , and epithelial cell levels in induced sputum . Additional outcomes included the change in other sputum markers of airway inflammation , airway responsiveness , symptom control , and lung function . RESULTS Both treatments had no significant effect on induced sputum inflammatory cells , although there was a trend for a reduction in sputum eosinophils . Both treatments significantly improved airway responsiveness , whereas SFC generally led to greater improvements in symptom control and lung function than FP/M . FP/M led to significantly greater reductions in sputum cysteinyl leukotrienes than SFC ( treatment ratio 1.80 ; 95 % CI 1.09 , 2.94 ) . CONCLUSION Both treatments led to similar control of eosinophilic airway inflammation , although PEF and symptom control were better with SFC . STUDY NUMBER : SAM40030 ( SOLTA ) . <EOS>
