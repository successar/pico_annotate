<SOS> Lowering the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio is associated with the beneficial impact of pioglitazone on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in diabetic patients : insights from the PERISCOPE ( Pioglitazone Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation ) study . OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine the factors associated with the favorable effect of pioglitazone on atheroma progression . BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated coronary atheroma progression . Pioglitazone slowed progression compared with glimepiride in this population . METHODS In all , 360 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease were treated with pioglitazone or glimepiride for 18 months in the PERISCOPE ( Pioglitazone Effect on Regression of Intravascular Sonographic Coronary Obstruction Prospective Evaluation ) study . Coronary atheroma progression was evaluated by serial intravascular ultrasound . The relationship between changes in biochemical parameters , percent atheroma volume , and total atheroma volume was investigated . RESULTS Pioglitazone-treated patients demonstrated greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) and reductions in glycated hemoglobin , triglycerides , and C-reactive protein . Significant correlations were observed between changes in percent atheroma volume and triglycerides ( r = 0.15 , p = 0.04 ) , triglyceride/HDL-C ratio ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.03 ) , and glycated hemoglobin ( r = 0.16 , p = 0.03 ) with pioglitazone , and changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( r = -0.15 , p = 0.05 ) , apolipoprotein B ( r = -0.16 , p = 0.04 ) , and apolipoprotein A-I ( r = -0.20 , p = 0.01 ) with glimepiride . Substantial atheroma regression , compared to progression , was associated with greater relative increases in HDL-C ( 14.2 % vs. 7.8 % , p = 0.04 ) , relative decreases in triglycerides ( -13.3 % vs. -1.9 % , p = 0.045 ) , triglyceride/HDL-C ratio ( -22.5 vs. -9.9 % , p = 0.05 ) , and decrease in glycated hemoglobin ( -0.6 % vs. -0.3 % , p = 0.01 ) . Multivariable analysis revealed that pioglitazone-induced effects on triglyceride/HDL-C were associated with changes in percent atheroma volume ( p = 0.03 ) and total atheroma volume ( p = 0.02 ) . CONCLUSIONS Favorable effects of pioglitazone on the triglyceride/HDL-C ratio correlated with delayed atheroma progression in diabetic patients . This finding highlights the potential importance of targeting atherogenic dyslipidemia in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease . <EOS>
