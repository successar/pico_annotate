<SOS> Serum biochemical characteristics of Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) , in response to blood sampling after clove powder solution exposure . In order to investigate the effect of anesthesia on serum parameters , Beluga , Huso huso ( L. ) were blood-sampled immediately without anesthesia ( control ) or subjected to following anesthesia procedure : 40 , 120 , and 240 s exposure to 3,000 , 700 , and 500 mg l?? clove solution , respectively . Blood samples were collected after these periods , when fish were immobile and reached stage 4 anesthesia . Results showed that cortisol and glucose levels were significantly high in 700 and 500 but not 3,000 mg l?? group compared to control . Serum lactate levels were significantly high in 500 mg l?? group compared to control group . Lactate levels were not significantly differed between control , 3,000 , and 700 mg l?? groups . There were no significant differences in serum levels of cholesterol , total protein , lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase , Na? , Cl? , K? , and Ca?? . Results suggest that rapid anesthesia with higher dose is better than slow anesthesia with lower dose for blood sampling in Beluga . <EOS>
