<SOS> Preschoolers acquire general knowledge by sharing in pretense . Children acquire general knowledge about many kinds of things , but there are few known means by which this knowledge is acquired . In this article , it is proposed that children acquire generic knowledge by sharing in pretend play . In Experiment 1 , twenty-two 3- to 4-year-olds watched pretense in which a puppet represented a nerp ( an unfamiliar kind of animal ) . For instance , in one scenario , the nerp ate and disliked a carrot . When subsequently asked generic questions about real nerps , children 's responses suggested that they had learned general facts ( e.g. , nerps dislike carrots ) . In Experiment 2 , thirty-two 4- to 5-year-olds learned from scenarios lacking pretend speech or sound effects . The findings reveal a long overlooked means by which children can acquire generic knowledge . <EOS>
