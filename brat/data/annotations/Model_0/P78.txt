<SOS> Virtual reality hypnosis for pain associated with recovery from physical trauma . Pain following traumatic injuries is common , can impair injury recovery and is often inadequately treated . In particular , the role of adjunctive nonpharmacologic analgesic techniques is unclear . The authors report a randomized , controlled study of 21 hospitalized trauma patients to assess the analgesic efficacy of virtual reality hypnosis ( VRH ) -hypnotic induction and analgesic suggestion delivered by customized virtual reality ( VR ) hardware/software . Subjective pain ratings were obtained immediately and 8 hours after VRH ( used as an adjunct to standard analgesic care ) and compared to both adjunctive VR without hypnosis and standard care alone . VRH patients reported less pain intensity and less pain unpleasantness compared to control groups . These preliminary findings suggest that VRH analgesia is a novel technology worthy of further study , both to improve pain management and to increase availability of hypnotic analgesia to populations without access to therapist-provided hypnosis and suggestion . <EOS>
