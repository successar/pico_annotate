<SOS> Antioxidant supplementation and exercise-induced oxidative stress in the 60-year-old as measured by antipyrine hydroxylates . The effects of 12 weeks of antioxidant supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress were investigated in older adults ( 60 ( SE 1 ) years ; BMI 26 ( SE 1 ) kg/m ( 2 ) ) . Subjects were randomly divided in two groups : supplementation ( n 11 ) with 100 mg dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate , 200 mg ascorbic acid , and 2 mg beta-carotene , and placebo ( n 9 ) . Before and after the 12 week supplementation period , subjects cycled for 45 min at submaximal intensity ( 50 % maximal workload capacity ) . Antipyrine was used as marker for oxidative stress . Antipyrine reacts quickly with hydroxyl radicals to form para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine . The latter metabolite is not formed in man through the mono-oxygenase pathway of cytochrome P450 . Daily supplementation significantly increased plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene in the supplemented group ( Delta 14.4 ( SE 3.2 ) and 0.4 ( se 0.1 ) micromol/l ; P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 ) . No significant differences , within and between groups , were observed in the exercise-induced increase in the ratios para- and ortho-hydroxyantipyrine to antipyrine . In addition , supplementation did not affect the exercise-induced increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in plasma . In conclusion , in 60-year-old subjects antioxidant supplementation had no effect on the exercise-induced increase in oxidative stress as measured by free radical products of antipyrine . <EOS>
