<SOS> Effectiveness of hygienic-dietary recommendations as enhancers of antidepressant treatment in patients with depression : study protocol of a randomized controlled trial . BACKGROUND In recent years some studies have been published supporting the efficacy of light exposure , physical activity , sleep control and a Mediterranean diet pattern on the improvement or prevention of depression . However , to our knowledge , there have been no studies using all these measures together as an adjuvant antidepressant strategy . METHODS Multicenter , randomized , controlled , two arm-parallel , clinical trial . Eighty depressed patients undergoing standard antidepressant treatment will be advised to follow four additional hygienic-dietary recommendations about exercise , diet , sunlight exposure and sleep . Outcome measures will be assessed before and after the 6 month intervention period . DISCUSSION We expect the patients in the active recommendations group to experience a greater improvement in their depressive symptoms . If so , this would be a great support for doctors who might systematically recommend these simple and costless measures , especially in primary care . TRIAL REGISTRATION ISRCTN59506583 . <EOS>
